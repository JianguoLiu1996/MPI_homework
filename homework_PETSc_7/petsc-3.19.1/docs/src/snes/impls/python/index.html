# Nonlinear Solvers (SNES)

The Scalable Nonlinear Equations Solvers (`SNES`) component provides an
easy-to-use interface to Newton-type, quasi-Newton, full approximation scheme (FAS) multigrid, and other methods for solving systems of
nonlinear equations. User guide chapter: [](chapter_snes).

`SNES` internally employs `KSP` for the solution of its linear systems. `SNES` users can also set `KSP` options directly in application
codes by first extracting the `KSP` context from the `SNES` context via `SNESGetKSP()`
and then directly calling various `KSP` (and `PC`) routines,
