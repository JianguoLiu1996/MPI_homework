# PetscDTSimplexQuadratureType
A description of classes of quadrature rules for simplices 
## Synopsis
```
typedef enum {
  PETSCDTSIMPLEXQUAD_DEFAULT = -1,
  PETSCDTSIMPLEXQUAD_CONIC   = 0,
  PETSCDTSIMPLEXQUAD_MINSYM
} PetscDTSimplexQuadratureType;
```

## Values

- ***`PETSCDTSIMPLEXQUAD_DEFAULT` -*** Quadrature rule chosen by PETSc
- ***`PETSCDTSIMPLEXQUAD_CONIC`   -*** Quadrature rules constructed as
conically-warped tensor products of 1D
Gauss-Jacobi quadrature rules.  These are
explicitly computable in any dimension for any
degree, and the tensor-product structure can be
exploited by sum-factorization methods, but
they are not efficient in terms of nodes per
polynomial degree.
- ***`PETSCDTSIMPLEXQUAD_MINSYM`  -*** Quadrature rules that are fully symmetric
(symmetries of the simplex preserve the nodes
and weights) with minimal (or near minimal)
number of nodes.  In dimensions higher than 1
these are not simple to compute, so lookup
tables are used.
