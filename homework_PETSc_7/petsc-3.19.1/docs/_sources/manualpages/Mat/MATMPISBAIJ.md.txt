# MATMPISBAIJ
MATMPISBAIJ = "mpisbaij" - A matrix type to be used for distributed symmetric sparse block matrices, based on block compressed sparse row format.  Only the upper triangular portion of the "diagonal" portion of the matrix is stored. For complex numbers by default this matrix is symmetric, NOT Hermitian symmetric. To make it Hermitian symmetric you
can call `MatSetOption`(`Mat`, `MAT_HERMITIAN`);


## Options Database Key

- ***-mat_type mpisbaij -*** sets the matrix type to "mpisbaij" during a call to `MatSetFromOptions()`





## Note
The number of rows in the matrix must be less than or equal to the number of columns. Similarly the number of rows in the
diagonal portion of the matrix of each process has to less than or equal the number of columns.
