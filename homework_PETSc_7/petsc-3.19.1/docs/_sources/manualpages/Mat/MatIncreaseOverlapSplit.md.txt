# MatIncreaseOverlapSplit
Given a set of submatrices indicated by index sets across a sub communicator, replaces the index sets by larger ones that represent submatrices with additional overlap. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscmat.h" 
PetscErrorCode MatIncreaseOverlapSplit(Mat mat, PetscInt n, IS is[], PetscInt ov)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***mat -*** the matrix
- ***n   -*** the number of index sets
- ***is  -*** the array of index sets (these index sets will changed during the call)
- ***ov  -*** the additional overlap requested



## `   Options Database Key

- ***-mat_increase_overlap_scalable -*** use a scalable algorithm to compute the overlap (supported by MPIAIJ matrix)
