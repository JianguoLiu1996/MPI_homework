# MatIncreaseOverlap
Given a set of submatrices indicated by index sets, replaces the index sets by larger ones that represent submatrices with additional overlap. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscmat.h" 
PetscErrorCode MatIncreaseOverlap(Mat mat, PetscInt n, IS is[], PetscInt ov)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***mat -*** the matrix
- ***n   -*** the number of index sets
- ***is  -*** the array of index sets (these index sets will changed during the call)
- ***ov  -*** the additional overlap requested



## Options Database Key

- ***-mat_increase_overlap_scalable -*** use a scalable algorithm to compute the overlap (supported by MPIAIJ matrix)





## Note
The computed overlap preserves the matrix block sizes when the blocks are square.
That is: if a matrix nonzero for a given block would increase the overlap all columns associated with
that block are included in the overlap regardless of whether each specific column would increase the overlap.
