# MatCreateMPIBAIJWithArrays
creates a `MATMPIBAIJ` matrix using arrays that contain in standard block CSR format the local rows. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscmat.h"  
PetscErrorCode MatCreateMPIBAIJWithArrays(MPI_Comm comm, PetscInt bs, PetscInt m, PetscInt n, PetscInt M, PetscInt N, const PetscInt i[], const PetscInt j[], const PetscScalar a[], Mat *mat)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***comm -*** MPI communicator
- ***bs -*** the block size, only a block size of 1 is supported
- ***m -*** number of local rows (Cannot be `PETSC_DECIDE`)
- ***n -*** This value should be the same as the local size used in creating the
x vector for the matrix-vector product y = Ax. (or `PETSC_DECIDE` to have
calculated if N is given) For square matrices n is almost always m.
- ***M -*** number of global rows (or `PETSC_DETERMINE` to have calculated if m is given)
- ***N -*** number of global columns (or `PETSC_DETERMINE` to have calculated if n is given)
- ***i -*** row indices; that is i[0] = 0, i[row] = i[row-1] + number of block elements in that rowth block row of the matrix
- ***j -*** column indices
- ***a -*** matrix values



## Output Parameter

- ***mat -*** the matrix





## Notes
The `i`, `j`, and `a` arrays ARE copied by this routine into the internal format used by PETSc;
thus you CANNOT change the matrix entries by changing the values of a[] after you have
called this routine. Use `MatCreateMPIAIJWithSplitArrays()` to avoid needing to copy the arrays.

The order of the entries in values is the same as the block compressed sparse row storage format; that is, it is
the same as a three dimensional array in Fortran values(bs,bs,nnz) that contains the first column of the first
block, followed by the second column of the first block etc etc.  That is, the blocks are contiguous in memory
with column-major ordering within blocks.

The `i` and `j` indices are 0 based, and i indices are indices corresponding to the local `j` array.
