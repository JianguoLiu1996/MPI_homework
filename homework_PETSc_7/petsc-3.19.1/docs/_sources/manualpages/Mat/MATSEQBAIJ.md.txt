# MATSEQBAIJ
MATSEQBAIJ = "seqbaij" - A matrix type to be used for sequential block sparse matrices, based on block sparse compressed row format. 
## Options Database Keys

- ***-mat_type seqbaij -*** sets the matrix type to `MATSEQBAIJ` during a call to `MatSetFromOptions()`
- ***-mat_baij_mult_version version -*** indicate the version of the matrix-vector product to use (0 often indicates using BLAS)





## Notes
`MatSetOptions`(,`MAT_STRUCTURE_ONLY`,`PETSC_TRUE`) may be called for this matrix type. In this no
space is allocated for the nonzero entries and any entries passed with `MatSetValues()` are ignored

Run with `-info` to see what version of the matrix-vector product is being used
