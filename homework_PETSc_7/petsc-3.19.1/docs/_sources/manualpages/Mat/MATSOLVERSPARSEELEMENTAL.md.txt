# MATSOLVERSPARSEELEMENTAL
A solver package providing direct solvers for sparse distributed and sequential matrices via the external package Elemental Use ./configure --download-elemental to have PETSc installed with Elemental

Use -pc_type lu -pc_factor_mat_solver_type sparseelemental to use this direct solver

This is currently not supported.


## Developer Note
Jed Brown made the interface for Clique when it was a standalone package. Later Jack Poulson merged and refactored Clique into
Elemental but since the Clique interface was not tested in PETSc the interface was not updated for the new Elemental interface. Later Barry Smith updated
all the boilerplate for the Clique interface to SparseElemental but since the solver interface changed dramatically he did not update the code
that actually calls the SparseElemental solvers. We are waiting on someone who has a need to complete the SparseElemental interface from PETSc.
