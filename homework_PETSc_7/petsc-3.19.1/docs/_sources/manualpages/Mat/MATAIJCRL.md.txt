# MATAIJCRL
MATAIJCRL = "aijcrl" - A matrix type to be used for sparse matrices. 
## Options Database Key

- ***-mat_type aijcrl -*** sets the matrix type to "aijcrl" during a call to `MatSetFromOptions()`





## Note
This matrix type is identical to `MATSEQAIJCRL` when constructed with a single process communicator,
and `MATMPIAIJCRL` otherwise.  As a result, for single process communicators,
`MatSeqAIJSetPreallocation()` is supported, and similarly `MatMPIAIJSetPreallocation()` is supported
for communicators controlling multiple processes.  It is recommended that you call both of
the above preallocation routines for simplicity.
