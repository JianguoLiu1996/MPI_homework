# DMForestSetBaseDM
During the pre-setup phase, set the `DM` that defines the base mesh of a `DMFOREST` forest.  The forest will be hierarchically refined from the base, and all refinements/coarsenings of the forest will share its base.  In general, two forest must share a base to be comparable, to do things like construct interpolators. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdmforest.h"

```

## Input Parameters

- ***dm -*** the forest
- ***base -*** the base `DM` of the forest
