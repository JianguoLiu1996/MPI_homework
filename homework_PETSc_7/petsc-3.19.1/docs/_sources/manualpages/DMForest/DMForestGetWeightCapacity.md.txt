# DMForestGetWeightCapacity
Set the capacity of the current process when repartitioning a pre-adaptation forest (see `DMForestGetAdaptivityForest()`).  After partitioning, the ratio of the weight of each process's cells to the process's capacity will be roughly equal for all processes.  A capacity of 0 indicates that the current process should not have any cells after repartitioning.
