# DMForestSetAdaptivityLabel
During the pre-setup phase, set the label of the pre-adaptation forest (see `DMForestGetAdaptivityForest()`) that holds the adaptation flags (refinement, coarsening, or some combination).  The interpretation of the label values is up to the subtype of `DMFOREST`, but `DM_ADAPT_DETERMINE`, `DM_ADAPT_KEEP`, `DM_ADAPT_REFINE`, and `DM_ADAPT_COARSEN` have been reserved as choices that should be accepted by all subtypes.
