# DMForestGetAdaptivitySuccess
Return whether the requested adaptation (refinement, coarsening, repartitioning, etc.) was successful. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdmforest.h" 
#include "petscdm.h" 
#include "petscdmlabel.h" 
PetscErrorCode DMForestGetAdaptivitySuccess(DM dm, PetscBool *success)
```
Collective


## Input Parameter

- ***dm -*** the post-adaptation forest



## Output Parameter

- ***success -*** `PETSC_TRUE` if the post-adaptation forest is different from the pre-adaptation forest.





## Notes
`PETSC_FALSE` indicates that the post-adaptation forest is the same as the pre-adpatation
forest.  A requested adaptation may have been unsuccessful if, for example, the requested refinement would have
exceeded the maximum refinement level.
