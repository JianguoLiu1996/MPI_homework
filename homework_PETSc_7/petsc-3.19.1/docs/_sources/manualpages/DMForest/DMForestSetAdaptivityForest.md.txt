# DMForestSetAdaptivityForest
During the pre-setup phase, set the forest from which the current forest will be adapted (e.g., the current forest will be refined/coarsened/repartitioned from it) in `DMSetUp()`.  Usually not needed by users directly: `DMForestTemplate()` constructs a new forest to be adapted from an old forest and calls this routine. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdmforest.h" 
#include "petscdm.h" 
#include "petscdmlabel.h" 
PetscErrorCode DMForestSetAdaptivityForest(DM dm, DM adapt)
```
Logically Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***dm -*** the new forest, which will be constructed from adapt
- ***adapt -*** the old forest





## Note
This can be called after setup with `adapt` = `NULL`, which will clear all internal data related to the
adaptivity forest from `dm`.  This way, repeatedly adapting does not leave stale `DM` objects in memory.
