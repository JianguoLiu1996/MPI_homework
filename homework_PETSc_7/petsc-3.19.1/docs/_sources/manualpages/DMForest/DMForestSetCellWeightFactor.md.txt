# DMForestSetCellWeightFactor
During the pre-setup phase, set the factor by which the level of refinement changes the cell weight (see `DMForestSetCellWeights()`) when calculating partitions.  The final weight of a cell will be (cellWeight) * (weightFactor^refinementLevel).  A factor of 1 indicates that the weight of a cell does not depend on its level; a factor of 2, for example, might be appropriate for sub-cycling time-stepping methods, when the computation associated with a cell is multiplied by a factor of 2 for each additional level of refinement.
