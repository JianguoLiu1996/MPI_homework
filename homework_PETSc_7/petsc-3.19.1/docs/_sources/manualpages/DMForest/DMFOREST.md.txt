# DMFOREST
"forest" - A DM object that encapsulates a hierarchically refined mesh.  Forests usually have a base `DM` (see `DMForestGetBaseDM()`), from which it is refined.  The refinement and partitioning of forests is considered immutable after `DMSetUp()` is called.  To adapt a mesh, one should call `DMForestTemplate()` to create a new mesh that will default to being identical to it, specify how that mesh should differ, and then calling `DMSetUp()` on the new mesh. To specify that a mesh should be refined or coarsened from the previous mesh, a label should be defined on the
previous mesh whose values indicate which cells should be refined (`DM_ADAPT_REFINE`) or coarsened (`DM_ADAPT_COARSEN`)
and how (subtypes are free to allow additional values for things like anisotropic refinement).  The label should be
given to the *new* mesh with `DMForestSetAdaptivityLabel()`.
