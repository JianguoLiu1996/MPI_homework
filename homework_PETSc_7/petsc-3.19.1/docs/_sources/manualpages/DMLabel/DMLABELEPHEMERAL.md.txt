# DMLABELEPHEMERAL
"ephemeral" - This type of `DMLabel` is used to label ephemeral meshes. Ephemeral meshes are never concretely instantiated, but rather the answers to queries are created on the fly from a base mesh and a `DMPlexTransform` object.
For example, we could integrate over a refined mesh without ever storing the entire thing, just producing each cell closure one at a time. The label consists
of a base label and the same transform. Stratum are produced on demand, so that the time is in $O(max(M, N))$ where $M$ is the size of the original stratum,
and $N$ is the size of the output stratum. Queries take the same time, since we cannot sort the output.
