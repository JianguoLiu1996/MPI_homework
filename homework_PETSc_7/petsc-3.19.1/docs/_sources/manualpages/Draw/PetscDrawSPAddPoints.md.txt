Adds several points to each of the scatter plot point curves. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdraw.h" 
#include "petscsys.h" 
PetscErrorCode PetscDrawSPAddPoints(PetscDrawSP sp, int n, PetscReal **xx, PetscReal **yy)
```
Not Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***sp -*** the scatter plot context
- ***xx -*** array of pointers that point to arrays containing the new x coordinates for each curve.
- ***yy -*** array of pointers that point to arrays containing the new y points for each curve.
- ***n -*** number of points being added, each represents a subarray of length dim where dim is the value from `PetscDrawSPGetDimension()`





## Note
The new points will not be displayed until a call to `PetscDrawSPDraw()` is made
