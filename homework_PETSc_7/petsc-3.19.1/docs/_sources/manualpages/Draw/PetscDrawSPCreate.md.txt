# PetscDrawSPCreate
Creates a scatter plot data structure. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdraw.h" 
#include "petscsys.h" 
PetscErrorCode PetscDrawSPCreate(PetscDraw draw, int dim, PetscDrawSP *drawsp)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***win -*** the window where the graph will be made.
- ***dim -*** the number of sets of points which will be drawn



## Output Parameter

- ***drawsp -*** the scatter plot context





## Notes
Add points to the plot with `PetscDrawSPAddPoint()` or `PetscDrawSPAddPoints()`; the new points are not displayed until `PetscDrawSPDraw()` is called.

`PetscDrawSPReset()` removes all the points that have been added

`PetscDrawSPSetDimension()` determines how many point curves are being plotted.

The MPI communicator that owns the `PetscDraw` owns this `PetscDrawSP`, and each process can add points. All MPI ranks in the communicator must call `PetscDrawSPDraw()` to display the updated graph.
