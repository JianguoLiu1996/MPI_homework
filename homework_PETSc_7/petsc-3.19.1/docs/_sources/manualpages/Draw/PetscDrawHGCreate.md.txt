# PetscDrawHGCreate
Creates a histogram data structure. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdraw.h" 
#include "petscsys.h" 
#include "petscviewer.h" 
PetscErrorCode PetscDrawHGCreate(PetscDraw draw, int bins, PetscDrawHG *hist)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***draw  -*** The window where the graph will be made
- ***bins -*** The number of bins to use



## Output Parameter

- ***hist -*** The histogram context





## Notes
The difference between a bar chart, `PetscDrawBar`, and a histogram, `PetscDrawHG`, is explained here https://stattrek.com/statistics/charts/histogram.aspx?Tutorial=AP

The histogram is only displayed when `PetscDrawHGDraw()` is called.

The MPI communicator that owns the `PetscDraw` owns this `PetscDrawHG`, but the calls to set options and add data are ignored on all processes except the
zeroth MPI process in the communicator. All MPI ranks in the communicator must call `PetscDrawHGDraw()` to display the updated graph.
