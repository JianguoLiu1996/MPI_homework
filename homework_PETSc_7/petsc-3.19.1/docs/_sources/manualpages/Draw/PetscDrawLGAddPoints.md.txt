# PetscDrawLGAddPoints
Adds several points to each of the line graphs. The new points must have an X coordinate larger than the old points. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdraw.h"  
PetscErrorCode PetscDrawLGAddPoints(PetscDrawLG lg, PetscInt n, PetscReal **xx, PetscReal **yy)
```
Logically Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***lg -*** the line graph context
- ***xx -*** array of pointers that point to arrays containing the new x coordinates for each curve.
- ***yy -*** array of pointers that point to arrays containing the new y points for each curve.
- ***n -*** number of points being added





## Notes
You must call `PetscDrawLGDraw()` to display any added points

Call `PetscDrawLGReset()` to remove all points
