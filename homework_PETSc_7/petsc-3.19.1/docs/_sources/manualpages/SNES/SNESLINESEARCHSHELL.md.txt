# SNESLINESEARCHSHELL
Provides context for a user-provided line search routine. The user routine has one argument, the SNESLineSearch context.  The user uses the interface to
extract line search parameters and set them accordingly when the computation is finished.

Any of the other line searches may serve as a guide to how this is to be done.  There is also a basic
template in the documentation for SNESLineSearchShellSetUserFunc().
