# SNESNGS
Either calls the user-provided solution routine provided with `SNESSetNGS()` or does a finite difference secant approximation using coloring. 


## Options Database Keys

- ***-snes_ngs_sweeps <n> -*** Number of sweeps of nonlinear GS to apply
- ***-snes_ngs_atol <atol> -*** Absolute residual tolerance for nonlinear GS iteration
- ***-snes_ngs_rtol <rtol> -*** Relative residual tolerance for nonlinear GS iteration
- ***-snes_ngs_stol <stol> -*** Absolute update tolerance for nonlinear GS iteration
- ***-snes_ngs_max_it <maxit> -*** Maximum number of sweeps of nonlinea GS to apply
- ***-snes_ngs_secant -*** Use pointwise secant local Jacobian approximation with coloring instead of user provided Gauss-Seidel routine, this is
used by default if no user provided Gauss-Seidel routine is available. Requires either that a `DM` that can compute a coloring
is available or a Jacobian sparse matrix is provided (from which to get the coloring).
- ***-snes_ngs_secant_h <h> -*** Differencing parameter for secant approximation
- ***-snes_ngs_secant_mat_coloring -*** Use the graph coloring of the Jacobian for the secant GS even if a DM is available.
- ***-snes_norm_schedule <none, always, initialonly, finalonly, initialfinalonly> -*** how often the residual norms are computed



## Notes
the Gauss-Seidel smoother is inherited through composition.  If a solver has been created with `SNESGetNPC()`, it will have
its parent's Gauss-Seidel routine associated with it.

By default this routine computes the solution norm at each iteration, this can be time consuming, you can turn this off with `SNESSetNormSchedule()`
or -snes_norm_schedule none
