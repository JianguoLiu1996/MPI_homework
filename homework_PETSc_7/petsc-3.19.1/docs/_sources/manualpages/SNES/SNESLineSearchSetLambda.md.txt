# SNESLineSearchSetLambda
Sets the linesearch steplength 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsnes.h" 
PetscErrorCode SNESLineSearchSetLambda(SNESLineSearch linesearch, PetscReal lambda)
```

## Input Parameters

- ***linesearch -*** linesearch context
- ***lambda -*** The last steplength.





## Note
This routine is typically used within implementations of `SNESLineSearchApply()`
to set the final steplength.  This routine (and `SNESLineSearchGetLambda()`) were
added in order to facilitate Quasi-Newton methods that use the previous steplength
as an inner scaling parameter.


## See Also
 `SNESLineSearch`, `SNESLineSearchGetLambda()`

## Level
advanced
