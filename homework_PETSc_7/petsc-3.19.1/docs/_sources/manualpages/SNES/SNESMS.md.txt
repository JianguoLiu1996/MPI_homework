# SNESMS
multi-stage smoothers 
## Options Database Keys

- ***-snes_ms_type -*** type of multi-stage smoother
- ***-snes_ms_damping -*** damping for multi-stage method



## Notes
These multistage methods are explicit Runge-Kutta methods that are often used as smoothers for
FAS multigrid for transport problems. In the linear case, these are equivalent to polynomial smoothers (such as Chebyshev).

Multi-stage smoothers should usually be preconditioned by point-block Jacobi to ensure proper scaling and to normalize the wave speeds.

The methods are specified in low storage form (Ketcheson 2010). New methods can be registered with `SNESMSRegister()`.
