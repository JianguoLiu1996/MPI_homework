# SNESSetUseMatrixFree
indicates that `SNES` should use matrix free finite difference matrix vector products to apply the Jacobian. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsnes.h"  
PetscErrorCode SNESSetUseMatrixFree(SNES snes, PetscBool mf_operator, PetscBool mf)
```
Logically Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***snes -*** `SNES` context
- ***mf_operator -*** use matrix-free only for the Amat used by `SNESSetJacobian()`, this means the user provided Pmat will continue to be used
- ***mf -*** use matrix-free for both the Amat and Pmat used by `SNESSetJacobian()`, both the Amat and Pmat set in `SNESSetJacobian()` will be ignored. With
this option no matrix element based preconditioners can be used in the linear solve since the matrix won't be explicitly available



## Options Database Keys

- ***-snes_mf_operator -*** use matrix free only for the mat operator
- ***-snes_mf -*** use matrix-free for both the mat and pmat operator
- ***-snes_fd_color -*** compute the Jacobian via coloring and finite differences.
- ***-snes_fd -*** compute the Jacobian via finite differences (slow)





## Note
`SNES` supports three approaches for computing (approximate) Jacobians: user provided via `SNESSetJacobian()`, matrix-free, and computing explicitly with
finite differences and coloring using `MatFDColoring`. It is also possible to use automatic differentiation and the `MatFDColoring` object.
