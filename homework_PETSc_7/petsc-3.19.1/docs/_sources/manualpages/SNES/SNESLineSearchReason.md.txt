# SNESLineSearchReason
indication if the line search has succeeded or failed and why 
## Synopsis
```
typedef enum {
  SNES_LINESEARCH_SUCCEEDED,
  SNES_LINESEARCH_FAILED_NANORINF,
  SNES_LINESEARCH_FAILED_DOMAIN,
  SNES_LINESEARCH_FAILED_REDUCT, /* INSUFFICIENT REDUCTION */
  SNES_LINESEARCH_FAILED_USER,
  SNES_LINESEARCH_FAILED_FUNCTION
} SNESLineSearchReason;
```

## Values

- ***`SNES_LINESEARCH_SUCCEEDED` -*** the line search succeeded
- ***`SNES_LINESEARCH_FAILED_NANORINF` -*** a not a number of infinity appeared in the computions
- ***`SNES_LINESEARCH_FAILED_DOMAIN` -*** the function was evaluated outside of its domain, see `SNESSetFunctionDomainError()` and `SNESSetJacobianDomainError()`
- ***`SNES_LINESEARCH_FAILED_REDUCT` -*** the linear search failed to get the requested decrease in its norm or objective
- ***`SNES_LINESEARCH_FAILED_USER` -*** used by `SNESLINESEARCHNLEQERR` to indicate the user changed the search direction inappropriately
- ***`SNES_LINESEARCH_FAILED_FUNCTION` -*** indicates the maximum number of function evaluations allowed has been surpassed, `SNESConvergedReason` is also
set to `SNES_DIVERGED_FUNCTION_COUNT`





## Developer Note
Some of these reasons overlap with values of `SNESConvergedReason`
