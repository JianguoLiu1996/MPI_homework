# SNES_NORM_INITIAL_ONLY
Compute the function and its L2 at iteration 0, but do not update it. 


## Notes
This method is useful in composed methods, when a true solution might actually be found before `SNESSolve()` is called.
This option enables the solve to abort on the zeroth iteration if this is the case.

For solvers that require the computation of the L2 norm of the function as part of the method, this merely cancels
the norm computation at the last iteration (if possible).
