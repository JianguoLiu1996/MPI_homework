## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsnes.h" 
PetscErrorCode SNESLineSearchSetComputeNorms(SNESLineSearch linesearch, PetscBool flg)
```

## Input Parameters

- ***linesearch  -*** linesearch context
- ***flg  -*** indicates whether or not to compute norms



## Options Database Key

- ***-snes_linesearch_norms <true> -*** Turns on/off computation of the norms for basic (none) linesearch





## Note
This is most relevant to the `SNESLINESEARCHBASIC` (or equivalently `SNESLINESEARCHNONE`) line search type since most line searches have a stopping criteria involving the norm.
