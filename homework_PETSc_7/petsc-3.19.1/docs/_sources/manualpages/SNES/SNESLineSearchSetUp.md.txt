# SNESLineSearchSetUp
Prepares the line search for being applied by allocating any required vectors. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsnes.h" 
PetscErrorCode SNESLineSearchSetUp(SNESLineSearch linesearch)
```
Collective


## Input Parameter

- ***linesearch -*** The `SNESLineSearch` instance.





## Note
For most cases, this needn't be called by users or outside of `SNESLineSearchApply()`.
The only current case where this is called outside of this is for the VI
solvers, which modify the solution and work vectors before the first call
of `SNESLineSearchApply()`, requiring the `SNESLineSearch` work vectors to be
allocated upfront.


## See Also
 `SNESLineSearch`, `SNESGetLineSearch()`, `SNESLineSearchReset()`

## Level
advanced
