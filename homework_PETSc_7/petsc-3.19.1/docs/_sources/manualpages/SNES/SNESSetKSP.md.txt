# SNESSetKSP
Sets a `KSP` context for the `SNES` object to use 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsnes.h"  
PetscErrorCode SNESSetKSP(SNES snes, KSP ksp)
```
Not Collective, but the `SNES` and `KSP` objects must live on the same MPI_Comm


## Input Parameters

- ***snes -*** the `SNES` context
- ***ksp -*** the `KSP` context





## Notes
The `SNES` object already has its `KSP` object, you can obtain with `SNESGetKSP()`
so this routine is rarely needed.

The `KSP` object that is already in the `SNES` object has its reference count
decreased by one.
