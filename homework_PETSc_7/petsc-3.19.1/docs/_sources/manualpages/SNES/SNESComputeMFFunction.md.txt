# SNESComputeMFFunction
Calls the function that has been set with `SNESSetMFFunction()`. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsnes.h"  
PetscErrorCode SNESComputeMFFunction(SNES snes, Vec x, Vec y)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***snes -*** the `SNES` context
- ***x -*** input vector



## Output Parameter

- ***y -*** function vector, as set by `SNESSetMFFunction()`





## Notes
`SNESComputeMFFunction()` is used within the matrix vector products called by the matrix created with `MatCreateSNESMF()`
so users would not generally call this routine themselves.

Since this function is intended for use with finite differencing it does not subtract the right hand side vector provided with `SNESSolve()`
while `SNESComputeFunction()` does. As such, this routine cannot be used with  `MatMFFDSetBase()` with a provided F function value even if it applies the
same function as `SNESComputeFunction()` if a `SNESSolve()` right hand side vector is use because the two functions difference would include this right hand side function.
