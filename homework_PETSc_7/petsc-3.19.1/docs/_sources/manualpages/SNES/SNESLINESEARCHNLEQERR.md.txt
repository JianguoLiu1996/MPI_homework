# SNESLINESEARCHNLEQERR
Error-oriented affine-covariant globalised Newton algorithm of Deuflhard (2011). This linesearch is intended for Newton-type methods which are affine covariant. Affine covariance
means that Newton's method will give the same iterations for F(x) = 0 and AF(x) = 0 for a nonsingular
matrix A. This is a fundamental property; the philosophy of this linesearch is that globalisations
of Newton's method should carefully preserve it.
