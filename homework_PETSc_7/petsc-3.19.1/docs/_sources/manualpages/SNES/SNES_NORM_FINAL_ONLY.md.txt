# SNES_NORM_FINAL_ONLY
Compute the function and its L2 norm on only the final iteration. 


## Note
For solvers that require the computation of the L2 norm of the function as part of the method, behaves
exactly as `SNES_NORM_DEFAULT`.  This method is useful when the function is gotten after `SNESSolve()` and
used in subsequent computation for methods that do not need the norm computed during the rest of the
solution procedure.
