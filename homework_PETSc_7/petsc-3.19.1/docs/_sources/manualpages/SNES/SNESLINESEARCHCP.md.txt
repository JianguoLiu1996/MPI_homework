# SNESLINESEARCHCP
Critical point line search. This line search assumes that there exists some artificial G(x) for which the `SNESFunction` F(x) = grad G(x).  Therefore, this line search seeks to find roots of dot(F, Y) via a secant method. 
## Options Database Keys

- ***-snes_linesearch_minlambda <minlambda> -*** the minimum acceptable lambda
- ***-snes_linesearch_maxstep <length> -*** the algorithm insures that a step length is never longer than this value
- ***-snes_linesearch_damping <damping> -*** initial trial step length is scaled by this factor, default is 1.0
- ***-snes_linesearch_max_it <max_it> -*** the maximum number of secant steps performed.



## Notes
This method does NOT use the objective function if it is provided with `SNESSetObjective()`.

This method is the preferred line search for `SNESQN` and `SNESNCG`.
