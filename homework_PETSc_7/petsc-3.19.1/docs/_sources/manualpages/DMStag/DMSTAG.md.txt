# DMSTAG
`"stag"` - A `DM` object representing a "staggered grid" or a structured cell complex. 


## Notes
This implementation parallels the `DMDA` implementation in many ways, but allows degrees of freedom
to be associated with all "strata" in a logically-rectangular grid.

Each stratum can be characterized by the dimension of the entities ("points", to borrow the `DMPLEX`
terminology), from 0- to 3-dimensional.

In some cases this numbering is used directly, for example with `DMStagGetDOF()`.
To allow easier reading and to some extent more similar code between different-dimensional implementations
of the same problem, we associate canonical names for each type of point, for each dimension of DMStag.

* 1-dimensional `DMSTAG` objects have vertices (0D) and elements (1D).
* 2-dimensional `DMSTAG` objects have vertices (0D), faces (1D), and elements (2D).
* 3-dimensional `DMSTAG` objects have vertices (0D), edges (1D), faces (2D), and elements (3D).

This naming is reflected when viewing a `DMSTAG` object with `DMView()`, and in forming
convenient options prefixes when creating a decomposition with `DMCreateFieldDecomposition()`.
