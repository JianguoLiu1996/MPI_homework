  `MPI Documentation <https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/current/>`__

The manual pages are split into four categories; we recommend that
you begin with basic functionality and then gradually explore more
sophisticated library features.

- *Beginner* - Basic usage
- *Intermediate* - Setting options for algorithms and data structures
- *Advanced* - Setting more advanced options and customization
- *Developer* - Interfaces intended primarily for library developers
