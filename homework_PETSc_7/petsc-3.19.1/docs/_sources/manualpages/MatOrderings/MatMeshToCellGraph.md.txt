# MatMeshToCellGraph
Uses the ParMETIS package to convert a `Mat` that represents coupling of vertices of a mesh to a `Mat` the represents the graph of the coupling between cells (the "dual" graph) and is suitable for partitioning with the `MatPartitioning` object. Use this to partition cells of a mesh. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscmat.h" 
PetscErrorCode MatMeshToCellGraph(Mat mesh, PetscInt ncommonnodes, Mat *dual)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***mesh -*** the graph that represents the coupling of the vertices of the mesh
- ***ncommonnodes -*** mesh elements that share this number of common nodes are considered neighbors, use 2 for triangles and
quadrilaterials, 3 for tetrahedrals and 4 for hexahedrals



## Output Parameter

- ***dual -*** the dual graph





## Notes
Currently requires ParMetis to be installed and uses ParMETIS_V3_Mesh2Dual()

Each row of the mesh object represents a single cell in the mesh. For triangles it has 3 entries, quadrilaterials 4 entries,
tetrahedrals 4 entries and hexahedrals 8 entries. You can mix triangles and quadrilaterals in the same mesh, but cannot
mix  tetrahedrals and hexahedrals
The columns of each row of the `Mat` mesh are the global vertex numbers of the vertices of that row's cell.
The number of rows in mesh is number of cells, the number of columns is the number of vertices.
