# MatPartitioningSetPartitionWeights
Sets the weights for each partition. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscmat.h" 
PetscErrorCode MatPartitioningSetPartitionWeights(MatPartitioning part, const PetscReal weights[])
```
Logically Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***part -*** the partitioning context
- ***weights -*** An array of size nparts that is used to specify the fraction of
vertex weight that should be distributed to each sub-domain for
the balance constraint. If all of the sub-domains are to be of
the same size, then each of the nparts elements should be set
to a value of 1/nparts. Note that the sum of all of the weights
should be one.





## Note
The array weights is freed by PETSc so the user should not free the array. In C/C++
the array must be obtained with a call to `PetscMalloc()`, not malloc().
