# MATPARTITIONINGHIERARCH
Creates a partitioning context via hierarchical partitioning strategy. The graph is partitioned into a number of subgraphs, and each subgraph is further split into a few smaller subgraphs. The idea can be applied in a recursive manner. It is useful when you want to partition the graph into a large number of subgraphs (often more than 10K) since partitions obtained with existing partitioners such as ParMETIS and PTScotch are far from ideal. The hierarchical partitioning also tries to avoid off-node communication as much as possible for multi-core processor. Another user case for the hierarchical partitioning is to improve `PCGASM` convergence by generating multi-rank connected subdomain. Collective


## Input Parameter

- ***part -*** the partitioning context



## Options Database Keys

- ***-mat_partitioning_hierarchical_coarseparttype -*** partitioner type at the first level and parmetis is used by default
- ***-mat_partitioning_hierarchical_fineparttype -*** partitioner type at the second level and parmetis is used by default
- ***-mat_partitioning_hierarchical_ncoarseparts -*** number of subgraphs is required at the first level, which is often the number of compute nodes
- ***-mat_partitioning_hierarchical_nfineparts -*** number of smaller subgraphs for each subgraph, which is often the number of cores per compute node
