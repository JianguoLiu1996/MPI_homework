# MatPartitioningRegisterAll
Registers all of the matrix partitioning routines in PETSc. 
## Synopsis
```
PetscErrorCode MatPartitioningRegisterAll(void)
```
Not Collective




## Adding new methods
To add a new method to the registry. Copy this routine and
modify it to incorporate a call to `MatPartitioningRegister()` for
the new method, after the current list.

Restricting the choices: To prevent all of the methods from being
registered and thus save memory, copy this routine and modify it to
register a zero, instead of the function name, for those methods you
do not wish to register.  Make sure that the replacement routine is
linked before libpetscmat.a.
