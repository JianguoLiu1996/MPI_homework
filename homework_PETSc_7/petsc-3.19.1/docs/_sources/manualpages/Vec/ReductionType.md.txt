# ReductionType
determines what type of column reduction (one that is not a type of norm defined in `NormType`) to compute 
## Synopsis
```
typedef enum {
  REDUCTION_SUM_REALPART       = 10,
  REDUCTION_MEAN_REALPART      = 11,
  REDUCTION_SUM_IMAGINARYPART  = 12,
  REDUCTION_MEAN_IMAGINARYPART = 13
} ReductionType;
```

## Values

- ***`REDUCTION_SUM_REALPART` -*** sum of real part of each matrix column
- ***`REDUCTION_SUM_IMAGINARYPART` -*** sum of imaginary part of each matrix column
- ***`REDUCTION_MEAN_REALPART` -*** arithmetic mean of real part of each matrix column
- ***`REDUCTION_MEAN_IMAGINARYPART` -*** arithmetic mean of imaginary part of each matrix column





## Developer Note
The constants defined in `ReductionType` MUST BE DISTINCT from those defined in `NormType`.
This is because `MatGetColumnReductions()` is used to compute both norms and other types of reductions,
and the constants defined in both `NormType` and `ReductionType` are used to designate the desired operation.
