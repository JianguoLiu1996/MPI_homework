# VecDotRealPart
Computes the real part of the vector dot product. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscvec.h"   
PetscErrorCode VecDotRealPart(Vec x, Vec y, PetscReal *val)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***x -*** first vector
- ***y -*** second vector



## Output Parameter

- ***val -*** the real part of the dot product;





## Performance Issues
```none
    per-processor memory bandwidth
    interprocessor latency
    work load imbalance that causes certain processes to arrive much earlier than others
```



## Notes for Users of Complex Numbers
See `VecDot()` for more details on the definition of the dot product for complex numbers

For real numbers this returns the same value as `VecDot()`

For complex numbers in C^n (that is a vector of n components with a complex number for each component) this is equal to the usual real dot product on the
the space R^{2n} (that is a vector of 2n components with the real or imaginary part of the complex numbers for components)


## Developer Note
This is not currently optimized to compute only the real part of the dot product.
