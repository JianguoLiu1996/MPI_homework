# Vecs
Collection of vectors where the data for the vectors is stored in one contiguous memory 
## Synopsis
```
struct _n_Vecs {
  PetscInt n;
  Vec      v;
};
```



## Notes
Temporary construct for handling multiply right hand side solves

This is faked by storing a single vector that has enough array space for
n vectors


## Level
advanced
