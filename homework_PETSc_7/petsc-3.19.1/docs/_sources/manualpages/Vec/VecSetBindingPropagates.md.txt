# VecSetBindingPropagates
Sets whether the state of being bound to the CPU for a GPU vector type propagates to child and some other associated objects 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscvec.h"   
PetscErrorCode VecSetBindingPropagates(Vec v, PetscBool flg)
```

## Input Parameters

- ***v -*** the vector
- ***flg -*** flag indicating whether the boundtocpu flag should be propagated





## Notes
If the value of flg is set to true, then `VecDuplicate()` and `VecDuplicateVecs()` will bind created vectors to GPU if the input vector is bound to the CPU.
The created vectors will also have their bindingpropagates flag set to true.


## Developer Note
If a `DMDA` has the `-dm_bind_below option` set to true, then vectors created by `DMCreateGlobalVector()` will have `VecSetBindingPropagates()` called on them to
set their bindingpropagates flag to true.
