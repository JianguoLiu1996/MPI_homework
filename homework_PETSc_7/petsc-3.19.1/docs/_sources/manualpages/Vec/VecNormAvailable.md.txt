# VecNormAvailable
Returns the vector norm if it is already known. That is, it has been previously computed and cached in the vector 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscvec.h"   
PetscErrorCode VecNormAvailable(Vec x, NormType type, PetscBool *available, PetscReal *val)
```
Not Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***x -*** the vector
- ***type -*** one of `NORM_1` (sum_i |x[i]|), `NORM_2` sqrt(sum_i (x[i])^2), `NORM_INFINITY` max_i |x[i]|.  Also available
`NORM_1_AND_2`, which computes both norms and stores them
in a two element array.



## Output Parameters

- ***available -*** `PETSC_TRUE` if the val returned is valid
- ***val -*** the norm





## Performance Issues
```none
    per-processor memory bandwidth
    interprocessor latency
    work load imbalance that causes certain processes to arrive much earlier than others
```



## Developer Note
`PETSC_HAVE_SLOW_BLAS_NORM2` will cause a C (loop unrolled) version of the norm to be used, rather
than the BLAS. This should probably only be used when one is using the FORTRAN BLAS routines
(as opposed to vendor provided) because the FORTRAN BLAS `NRM2()` routine is very slow.
