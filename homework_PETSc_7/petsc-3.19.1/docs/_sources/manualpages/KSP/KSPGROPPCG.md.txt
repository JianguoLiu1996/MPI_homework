# KSPGROPPCG
A pipelined conjugate gradient method developed by Bill Gropp. [](sec_pipelineksp) 


## Notes
This method has two reductions, one of which is overlapped with the matrix-vector product and one of which is
overlapped with the preconditioner.

See also `KSPPIPECG`, which has only a single reduction that overlaps both the matrix-vector product and the preconditioner.

MPI configuration may be necessary for reductions to make asynchronous progress, which is important for performance of pipelined methods.
