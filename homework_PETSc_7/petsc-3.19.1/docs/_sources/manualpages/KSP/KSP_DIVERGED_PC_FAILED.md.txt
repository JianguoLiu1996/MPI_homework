# KSP_DIVERGED_PC_FAILED
It was not possible to build or use the requested preconditioner. This is usually due to a zero pivot in a factorization. It can also result from a failure in a subpreconditioner inside a nested preconditioner such as `PCFIELDSPLIT`. 


## Note
Run with `-ksp_error_if_not_converged` to stop the program when the error is detected and print an error message with details.
