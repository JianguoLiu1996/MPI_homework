# KSPPIPEGCR
Implements a Pipelined Generalized Conjugate Residual method. [](sec_flexibleksp). [](sec_pipelineksp) 
## Options Database Keys

- ***-ksp_pipegcr_mmax <N>  -*** the max number of Krylov directions to orthogonalize against
- ***-ksp_pipegcr_unroll_w -*** unroll w at the storage cost of a maximum of (mmax+1) extra vectors with the benefit of better pipelining (default: `PETSC_TRUE`)
- ***-ksp_pipegcr_nprealloc <N> -*** the number of vectors to preallocated for storing Krylov directions. Once exhausted new directions are allocated blockwise (default: 5)
- ***-ksp_pipegcr_truncation_type <standard,notay> -*** which previous search directions to orthogonalize against





## Notes
The `KSPPIPEGCR` Krylov method supports non-symmetric matrices and permits the use of a preconditioner
which may vary from one iteration to the next. Users can can define a method to vary the
preconditioner between iterates via `KSPPIPEGCRSetModifyPC()`.
Restarts are solves with x0 not equal to zero. When a restart occurs, the initial starting
solution is given by the current estimate for x which was obtained by the last restart
iterations of the PIPEGCR algorithm.
The method implemented requires at most the storage of 4 x mmax + 5 vectors, roughly twice as much as GCR.

Only supports left preconditioning.

The natural "norm" for this method is (u,Au), where u is the preconditioned residual. This norm is available at no additional computational cost, as with standard CG.
Choosing preconditioned or unpreconditioned norm types involves a blocking reduction which prevents any benefit from pipelining.

MPI configuration may be necessary for reductions to make asynchronous progress, which is important for performance of pipelined methods.
