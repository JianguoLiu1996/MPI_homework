# KSPPIPECGRR
Pipelined conjugate gradient method with automated residual replacements. [](sec_pipelineksp) 


## Notes
This method has only a single non-blocking reduction per iteration, compared to 2 blocking for standard `KSPCG`.  The
non-blocking reduction is overlapped by the matrix-vector product and preconditioner application.

`KSPPIPECGRR` improves the robustness of `KSPPIPECG` by adding an automated residual replacement strategy.
True residual and other auxiliary variables are computed explicitly in a number of dynamically determined
iterations to counteract the accumulation of rounding errors and thus attain a higher maximal final accuracy.

See also `KSPPIPECG`, which is identical to `KSPPIPECGRR` without residual replacements.
See also `KSPPIPECR`, where the reduction is only overlapped with the matrix-vector product.

MPI configuration may be necessary for reductions to make asynchronous progress, which is important for
performance of pipelined methods. See [](doc_faq_pipelined)
