# KSPIBCGS
Implements the IBiCGStab (Improved Stabilized version of BiConjugate Gradient) method in an alternative form to have only a single global reduction operation instead of the usual 3 (or 4) 


## Notes
Supports left and right preconditioning

See `KSPBCGSL` for additional stabilization

Unlike the Bi-CG-stab algorithm, this requires one multiplication be the transpose of the operator
before the iteration starts.

The paper has two errors in the algorithm presented, they are fixed in the code in `KSPSolve_IBCGS()`

For maximum reduction in the number of global reduction operations, this solver should be used with
`KSPSetLagNorm()`.

This is not supported for complex numbers.
