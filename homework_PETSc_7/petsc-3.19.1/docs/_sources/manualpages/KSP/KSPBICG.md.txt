# KSPBICG
Implements the Biconjugate gradient method (similar to running the conjugate gradient on the normal equations). 


## Notes
This method requires that one be apply to apply the transpose of the preconditioner and operator
as well as the operator and preconditioner.

Supports only left preconditioning

See `KSPCGNE` for code that EXACTLY runs the preconditioned conjugate gradient method on the normal equations

See `KSPBCGS` for the famous stabilized variant of this algorithm
