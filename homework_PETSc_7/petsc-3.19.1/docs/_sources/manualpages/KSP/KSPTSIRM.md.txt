## Notes
`KSPTSIRM` is a two-stage iteration method for solving large sparse linear systems of the form Ax=b. The main idea behind this new
method is the use a least-squares residual minimization to improve the convergence of Krylov based iterative methods, typically those of GMRES variants.
The principle of TSIRM algorithm  is to build an outer iteration over a Krylov method, called the inner solver, and to frequently store the current residual
computed by the given Krylov method in a matrix of residuals S. After a few outer iterations, a least-squares minimization step is applied on the matrix
composed by the saved residuals, in order to compute a better solution and to make new iterations if required.
The minimization step consists in solving the least-squares problem min||b-ASa|| to find 'a' which minimizes the
residuals (b-AS). The minimization step is performed using two solvers of linear least-squares problems: `KSPCGLS`  or `KSPLSQR`. A new solution x with
a minimal residual is computed with x=Sa.
