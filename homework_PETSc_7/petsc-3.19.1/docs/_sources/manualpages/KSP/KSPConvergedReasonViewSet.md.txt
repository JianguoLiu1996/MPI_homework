# KSPConvergedReasonViewSet
Sets an ADDITIONAL function that is to be used at the end of the linear solver to display the convergence reason of the linear solver. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscksp.h" 
#include "petscmat.h" 
PetscErrorCode KSPConvergedReasonViewSet(KSP ksp, PetscErrorCode (*f)(KSP, void *), void *vctx, PetscErrorCode (*reasonviewdestroy)(void **))
```
Logically Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***ksp -*** the `KSP` context
- ***f -*** the ksp converged reason view function
- ***vctx -*** [optional] user-defined context for private data for the
ksp converged reason view routine (use `NULL` if no context is desired)
- ***reasonviewdestroy -*** [optional] routine that frees reasonview context
(may be `NULL`)



## Options Database Keys

- ***-ksp_converged_reason        -*** sets a default `KSPConvergedReasonView()`
- ***-ksp_converged_reason_view_cancel -*** cancels all converged reason viewers that have
been hardwired into a code by
calls to `KSPConvergedReasonViewSet()`, but
does not cancel those set via
the options database.



## Notes
Several different converged reason view routines may be set by calling
`KSPConvergedReasonViewSet()` multiple times; all will be called in the
order in which they were set.
