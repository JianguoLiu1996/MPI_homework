# KSPPIPECR
Pipelined conjugate residual method. [](sec_pipelineksp) 


## Notes
This method has only a single non-blocking reduction per iteration, compared to 2 blocking for standard `KSPCR`.  The
non-blocking reduction is overlapped by the matrix-vector product, but not the preconditioner application.

See also `KSPPIPECG`, where the reduction is only overlapped with the matrix-vector product.

MPI configuration may be necessary for reductions to make asynchronous progress, which is important for performance of pipelined methods.
