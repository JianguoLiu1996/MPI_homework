# MatLMVMSetJ0
Allows the user to define the initial Jacobian matrix from which the LMVM-type approximation is built up. Inverse of this initial Jacobian is applied using an internal `KSP` solver, which defaults to `KSPGMRES`. This internal `KSP` solver has the "mat_lmvm_" option prefix. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscksp.h" 
PetscErrorCode MatLMVMSetJ0(Mat B, Mat J0)
```
Note that another LMVM-type matrix can be used in place of
J0, in which case updating the outer LMVM-type matrix will
also trigger the update for the inner LMVM-type matrix. This
is useful in cases where a full-memory diagonal approximation
such as `MATLMVMDIAGBRDN` is used in place of J0.


## Input Parameters

- ***B -*** An LMVM-type matrix
- ***J0 -*** The initial Jacobian matrix
