# KSPNASH
Code to run conjugate gradient method subject to a constraint on the solution norm. 
## Options Database Keys

- ***-ksp_cg_radius <r> -*** Trust Region Radius





## Notes
This is rarely used directly, it is used in Trust Region methods for nonlinear equations, `SNESNEWTONTR`

Uses preconditioned conjugate gradient to compute
an approximate minimizer of the quadratic function

q(s) = g^T * s + 0.5 * s^T * H * s

subject to the trust region constraint

|| s || <= delta,

where

delta is the trust region radius,
g is the gradient vector,
H is the Hessian approximation, and
M is the positive definite preconditioner matrix.

`KSPConvergedReason` may be
```none
  KSP_CONVERGED_NEG_CURVE if convergence is reached along a negative curvature direction,
  KSP_CONVERGED_STEP_LENGTH if convergence is reached along a constrained step,
```

other `KSP` converged/diverged reasons

The preconditioner supplied should be symmetric and positive definite.
