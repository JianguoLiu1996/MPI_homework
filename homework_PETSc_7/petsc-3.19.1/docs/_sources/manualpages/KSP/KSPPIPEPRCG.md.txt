# KSPPIPEPRCG
Pipelined predict-and-recompute conjugate gradient method. [](sec_pipelineksp) 
## Options Database Key

- ***-ksp_pipeprcg_recompute_w -*** recompute the w_k with Ar_k, default is true





## Notes
This method has only a single non-blocking reduction per iteration, compared to 2 blocking for standard `KSPCG`.
The non-blocking reduction is overlapped by the matrix-vector product and preconditioner application.

MPI configuration may be necessary for reductions to make asynchronous progress, which is important for performance of pipelined methods.
