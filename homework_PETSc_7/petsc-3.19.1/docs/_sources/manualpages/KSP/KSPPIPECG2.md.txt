# KSPPIPECG2
Pipelined conjugate gradient method with a single non-blocking reduction per two iterations. [](sec_pipelineksp) 


## Notes
This method has only a single non-blocking reduction per two iterations, compared to 2 blocking for standard CG.  The
non-blocking reduction is overlapped by two matrix-vector products and two preconditioner applications.

MPI configuration may be necessary for reductions to make asynchronous progress, which is important for performance of pipelined methods.

## Developer Note
The implementation code contains a good amount of hand tuned fusion of multiple inner products and similar computations on multiple vectors
