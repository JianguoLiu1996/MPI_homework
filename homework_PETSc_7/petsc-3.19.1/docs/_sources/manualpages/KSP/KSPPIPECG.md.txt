# KSPPIPECG
Pipelined conjugate gradient method. [](sec_pipelineksp) 


## Notes
This method has only a single non-blocking reduction per iteration, compared to 2 blocking for standard CG.  The
non-blocking reduction is overlapped by the matrix-vector product and preconditioner application.

See also `KSPPIPECR`, where the reduction is only overlapped with the matrix-vector product and `KSPGROPPCG`

MPI configuration may be necessary for reductions to make asynchronous progress, which is important for performance of pipelined methods.
