# KSPPIPEBCGS
Implements a pipelined BiCGStab method. [](sec_pipelineksp) 


## Notes
This method has only two non-blocking reductions per iteration, compared to 3 blocking for standard FBCGS.  The
non-blocking reductions are overlapped by matrix-vector products and preconditioner applications.

Periodic residual replacement may be used to increase robustness and maximal attainable accuracy.

Like `KSPFBCGS`, the `KSPPIPEBCGS` implementation only allows for right preconditioning.

MPI configuration may be necessary for reductions to make asynchronous progress, which is important for
performance of pipelined methods. See [](doc_faq_pipelined)
