# KSPSetGuess
Set the initial guess object 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscksp.h" 
PetscErrorCode KSPSetGuess(KSP ksp, KSPGuess guess)
```
Logically Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***ksp -*** the Krylov context
- ***guess -*** the object created with `KSPGuessCreate()`





## Notes
this allows a single `KSP` to be used with several different initial guess generators (likely for different linear
solvers, see `KSPSetPC()`).

This increases the reference count of the guess object, you must destroy the object with `KSPGuessDestroy()`
before the end of the program.
