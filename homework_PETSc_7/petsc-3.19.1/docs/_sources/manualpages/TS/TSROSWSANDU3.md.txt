# TSROSWSANDU3
Three stage third order L-stable Rosenbrock scheme By default, the Jacobian is only recomputed once per step.

The third order method is L-stable, but not stiffly accurate.
The second order embedded method is strongly A-stable with R(infty) = 0.5.
The internal stages are L-stable.
This method is called ROS3 in the paper.
