# DMMOAB
"moab" - A DM object that encapsulates an unstructured mesh described by the MOAB mesh database. Direct access to the MOAB Interface and other mesh manipulation related objects are available through public API. Ability to create global and local representation of Vecs containing all unknowns in the interior and shared boundary via a transparent tag-data wrapper is provided along with utility functions to traverse the mesh and assemble a discrete system via field-based/blocked Vec(Get/Set) methods. Input from and output to different formats are available. Reference: https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~fathom/moab-docs/html/contents.html
