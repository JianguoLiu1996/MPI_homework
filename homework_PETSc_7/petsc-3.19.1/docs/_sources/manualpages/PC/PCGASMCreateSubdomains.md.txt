# PCGASMCreateSubdomains
Creates n index sets defining n nonoverlapping subdomains for the `PCGASM` additive Schwarz preconditioner for a any problem based on its matrix. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscpc.h" 
PetscErrorCode PCGASMCreateSubdomains(Mat A, PetscInt N, PetscInt *n, IS *iis[])
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***A       -*** The global matrix operator
- ***N       -*** the number of global subdomains requested



## Output Parameters

- ***n   -*** the number of subdomains created on this MPI rank
- ***iis -*** the array of index sets defining the local inner subdomains (on which the correction is applied)





## Note
When `N` >= A's communicator size, each subdomain is local -- contained within a single MPI rank.
When `N` < size, the subdomains are 'straddling' (rank boundaries) and are no longer local.
The resulting subdomains can be use in `PCGASMSetSubdomains`(pc,n,iss,`NULL`).  The overlapping
outer subdomains will be automatically generated from these according to the requested amount of
overlap; this is currently supported only with local subdomains.
