# PCVPBJACOBI
Variable size point block Jacobi preconditioner 


## Notes
See `PCJACOBI` for point Jacobi preconditioning, `PCPBJACOBI` for fixed point block size, and `PCBJACOBI` for large size blocks

This works for `MATAIJ` matrices

Uses dense LU factorization with partial pivoting to invert the blocks; if a zero pivot
is detected a PETSc error is generated.

One must call `MatSetVariableBlockSizes()` to use this preconditioner


## Developer Notes
This should support the `PCSetErrorIfFailure()` flag set to `PETSC_TRUE` to allow
the factorization to continue even after a zero pivot is found resulting in a Nan and hence
terminating `KSP` with a `KSP_DIVERGED_NANORINF` allowing
a nonlinear solver/ODE integrator to recover without stopping the program as currently happens.

Perhaps should provide an option that allows generation of a valid preconditioner
even if a block is singular as the `PCJACOBI` does.
