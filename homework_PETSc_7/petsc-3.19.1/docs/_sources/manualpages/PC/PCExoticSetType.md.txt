# PCExoticSetType
Sets the type of coarse grid interpolation to use 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdmda.h" 
#include "petscksp.h" 
PetscErrorCode PCExoticSetType(PC pc, PCExoticType type)
```
Logically Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***pc -*** the preconditioner context
- ***type -*** either PC_EXOTIC_FACE or PC_EXOTIC_WIREBASKET (defaults to face)



## Notes
The face based interpolation has 1 degree of freedom per face and ignores the
edge and vertex values completely in the coarse problem. For any seven point
stencil the interpolation of a constant on all faces into the interior is that constant.

The wirebasket interpolation has 1 degree of freedom per vertex, per edge and
per face. A constant on the subdomain boundary is interpolated as that constant
in the interior of the domain.

The coarse grid matrix is obtained via the Galerkin computation A_c = R A R^T, hence
if A is nonsingular A_c is also nonsingular.

Both interpolations are suitable for only scalar problems.
