# PCPBJACOBI
Point block Jacobi preconditioner 
## Notes
See `PCJACOBI` for diagonal Jacobi, `PCVPBJACOBI` for variable-size point block, and `PCBJACOBI` for large size blocks

This works for `MATAIJ` and `MATBAIJ` matrices and uses the blocksize provided to the matrix

Uses dense LU factorization with partial pivoting to invert the blocks; if a zero pivot
is detected a PETSc error is generated.


## Developer Notes
This should support the `PCSetErrorIfFailure()` flag set to `PETSC_TRUE` to allow
the factorization to continue even after a zero pivot is found resulting in a Nan and hence
terminating `KSP` with a `KSP_DIVERGED_NANORINF` allowing
a nonlinear solver/ODE integrator to recover without stopping the program as currently happens.

Perhaps should provide an option that allows generation of a valid preconditioner
even if a block is singular as the `PCJACOBI` does.
