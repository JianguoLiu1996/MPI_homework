# PCEXOTIC
Two level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner with exotic (non-standard) coarse grid spaces This uses the `PCMG` infrastructure restricted to two levels and the face and wirebasket based coarse
grid spaces.




## Notes
Must be used with `DMDA`

By default this uses `KSPGMRES` on the fine grid smoother so this should be used with `KSPFGMRES` or the smoother changed to not use `KSPGMRES`
