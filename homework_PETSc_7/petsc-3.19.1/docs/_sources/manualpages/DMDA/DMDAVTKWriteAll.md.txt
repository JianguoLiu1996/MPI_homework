# DMDAVTKWriteAll
Write a file containing all the fields that have been provided to the viewer 
## Synopsis
```
PetscErrorCode DMDAVTKWriteAll(PetscObject odm, PetscViewer viewer)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***odm -*** `DMDA` specifying the grid layout, passed as a `PetscObject`
- ***viewer -*** viewer of type `PETSCVIEWERVTK`





## Notes
This function is a callback used by the VTK viewer to actually write the file.
The reason for this odd model is that the VTK file format does not provide any way to write one field at a time.
Instead, metadata for the entire file needs to be available up-front before you can start writing the file.

If any fields have been named (see e.g. DMDASetFieldName()), then individual scalar
fields are written. Otherwise, a single multi-dof (vector) field is written.
