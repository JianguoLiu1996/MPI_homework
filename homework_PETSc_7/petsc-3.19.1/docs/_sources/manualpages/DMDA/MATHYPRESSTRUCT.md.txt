# MATHYPRESSTRUCT
MATHYPRESSTRUCT = "hypresstruct" - A matrix type to be used for parallel sparse matrices based on the hypre HYPRE_SStructMatrix. 


## Notes
Unlike hypre's general semi-struct object consisting of a collection of structured-grid objects and unstructured
grid objects, we restrict the semi-struct objects to consist of only structured-grid components.

Unlike the more general support for parts and blocks in hypre this allows only one part, and one block per process and requires the block
be defined by a `DMDA`.

The matrix needs a DMDA associated with it by either a call to MatSetDM() or if the matrix is obtained from DMCreateMatrix()
