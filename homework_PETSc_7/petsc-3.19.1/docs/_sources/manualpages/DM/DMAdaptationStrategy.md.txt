# DMAdaptationStrategy
Describes the strategy used for adaptive solves 
## Synopsis
```
typedef enum {
  DM_ADAPTATION_INITIAL,
  DM_ADAPTATION_SEQUENTIAL,
  DM_ADAPTATION_MULTILEVEL
} DMAdaptationStrategy;
```

## Values

- ***`DM_ADAPTATION_INITIAL` -*** refine a mesh based on an initial guess
- ***`DM_ADAPTATION_SEQUENTIAL` -*** refine the mesh based on a sequence of solves, much like grid sequencing
- ***`DM_ADAPTATION_MULTILEVEL` -*** use the sequence of constructed meshes in a multilevel solve, much like the Systematic Upscaling of Brandt
