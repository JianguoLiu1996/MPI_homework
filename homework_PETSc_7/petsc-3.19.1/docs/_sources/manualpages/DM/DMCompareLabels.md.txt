# DMCompareLabels
Compare labels of two `DMPLEX` meshes 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdm.h"          
#include "petscdmlabel.h"     
#include "petscds.h"     
PetscErrorCode DMCompareLabels(DM dm0, DM dm1, PetscBool *equal, char **message)
```
Collective; No Fortran Support


## Input Parameters

- ***dm0 -*** First `DM` object
- ***dm1 -*** Second `DM` object


Output Parameters

- ***equal   -*** (Optional) Flag whether labels of dm0 and dm1 are the same
- ***message -*** (Optional) Message describing the difference, or `NULL` if there is no difference





## Notes
The output flag equal will be the same on all processes.

If equal is passed as `NULL` and difference is found, an error is thrown on all processes.

Make sure to pass equal is `NULL` on all processes or none of them.

The output message is set independently on each rank.

message must be freed with `PetscFree()`

If message is passed as `NULL` and a difference is found, the difference description is printed to stderr in synchronized manner.

Make sure to pass message as `NULL` on all processes or no processes.

Labels are matched by name. If the number of labels and their names are equal,
`DMLabelCompare()` is used to compare each pair of labels with the same name.
