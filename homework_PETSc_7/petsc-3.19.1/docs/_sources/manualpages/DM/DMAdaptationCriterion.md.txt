# DMAdaptationCriterion
Describes the test used to decide whether to coarsen or refine parts of the mesh 
## Synopsis
```
typedef enum {
  DM_ADAPTATION_NONE,
  DM_ADAPTATION_REFINE,
  DM_ADAPTATION_LABEL,
  DM_ADAPTATION_METRIC
} DMAdaptationCriterion;
```

## Values

- ***`DM_ADAPTATION_REFINE` -*** uniformly refine a mesh, much like grid sequencing
- ***`DM_ADAPTATION_LABEL` -*** adapt the mesh based upon a label of the cells filled with `DMAdaptFlag` markers.
- ***`DM_ADAPTATION_METRIC` -*** try to mesh the manifold described by the input metric tensor uniformly. PETSc can also construct such a metric based
upon an input primal or a gradient field.
- ***`DM_ADAPTATION_NONE` -*** do no adaptation
