# DMPolytopeType
This describes the polytope represented by each cell. 
## Synopsis
```

  DM_POLYTOPE_POINT,
  DM_POLYTOPE_SEGMENT,
  DM_POLYTOPE_POINT_PRISM_TENSOR,
  DM_POLYTOPE_TRIANGLE,
  DM_POLYTOPE_QUADRILATERAL,
  DM_POLYTOPE_SEG_PRISM_TENSOR,
  DM_POLYTOPE_TETRAHEDRON,
  DM_POLYTOPE_HEXAHEDRON,
  DM_POLYTOPE_TRI_PRISM,
  DM_POLYTOPE_TRI_PRISM_TENSOR,
  DM_POLYTOPE_QUAD_PRISM_TENSOR,
  DM_POLYTOPE_PYRAMID,
  DM_POLYTOPE_FV_GHOST,
  DM_POLYTOPE_INTERIOR_GHOST,
  DM_POLYTOPE_UNKNOWN,
  DM_NUM_POLYTOPES
} DMPolytopeType;
```


While most operations only need the topology information in the `DMPLEX`, we must sometimes have the
user specify a polytope. For instance, when interpolating from a cell-vertex mesh, the type of
polytope can be ambiguous. Also, `DMPLEX` allows different symmetries of a prism cell with the same
constituent points. Normally these types are autoamtically inferred and the user does not specify
them.
