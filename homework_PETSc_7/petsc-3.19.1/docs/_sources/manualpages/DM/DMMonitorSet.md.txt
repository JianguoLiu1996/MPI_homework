# DMMonitorSet
Sets an additional monitor function that is to be used after a solve to monitor discretization performance. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdm.h"          
#include "petscdmlabel.h"     
#include "petscds.h"     
PetscErrorCode DMMonitorSet(DM dm, PetscErrorCode (*f)(DM, void *), void *mctx, PetscErrorCode (*monitordestroy)(void **))
```
Logically Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***DM -*** the `DM`
- ***f -*** the monitor function
- ***mctx -*** [optional] user-defined context for private data for the monitor routine (use `NULL` if no context is desired)
- ***monitordestroy -*** [optional] routine that frees monitor context (may be `NULL`)



## Options Database Key

- ***-dm_monitor_cancel -*** cancels all monitors that have been hardwired into a code by calls to `DMMonitorSet()`, but
does not cancel those set via the options database.





## Note
Several different monitoring routines may be set by calling
`DMMonitorSet()` multiple times or with `DMMonitorSetFromOptions()`; all will be called in the
order in which they were set.


## Fortran Note
Only a single monitor function can be set for each `DM` object


## Developer Note
This API has a generic name but seems specific to a very particular aspect of the use of `DM`
