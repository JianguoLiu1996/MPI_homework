PetscErrorCode PetscObjectViewSAWs(PetscObject obj, PetscViewer viewer)

## Input Parameters

- ***obj -*** the `PetscObject` variable. Thus must be cast with a (`PetscObject`), for example, `PetscObjectSetName`((`PetscObject`)mat,name);

## Note
The object must have already been named before calling this routine since naming an
object can be collective.
