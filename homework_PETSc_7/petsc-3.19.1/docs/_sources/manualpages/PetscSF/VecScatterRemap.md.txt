# VecScatterRemap
Remaps the "from" and "to" indices in a vector scatter context. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsf.h" 
PetscErrorCode VecScatterRemap(VecScatter sf, PetscInt tomap[], PetscInt frommap[])
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***sf    -*** vector scatter context
- ***tomap   -*** remapping plan for "to" indices (may be `NULL`).
- ***frommap -*** remapping plan for "from" indices (may be `NULL`)





## Notes
In the parallel case the todata contains indices from where the data is taken
(and then sent to others)! The fromdata contains indices from where the received
data is finally put locally.

In the sequential case the todata contains indices from where the data is put
and the fromdata contains indices from where the data is taken from.
This is backwards from the parallel case!
