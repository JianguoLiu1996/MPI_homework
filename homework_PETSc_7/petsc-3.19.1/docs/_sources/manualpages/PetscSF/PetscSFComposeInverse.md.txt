# PetscSFComposeInverse
Compose a new `PetscSF` by putting the inverse of the second `PetscSF` under the first one 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsf.h" 
PetscErrorCode PetscSFComposeInverse(PetscSF sfA, PetscSF sfB, PetscSF *sfBA)
```

## Input Parameters

- ***sfA -*** The first `PetscSF`
- ***sfB -*** The second `PetscSF`



## Output Parameter

- ***sfBA -*** The composite `PetscSF`.





## Notes
Currently, the two `PetscSF`s must be defined on congruent communicators and they must be true star
forests, i.e. the same leaf is not connected with different roots. Even more, all roots of the
second `PetscSF` must have a degree of 1, i.e., no roots have more than one leaf connected.

`sfA`'s leaf space and `sfB`'s leaf space might be partially overlapped. The composition builds
a graph with `sfA`'s roots and `sfB`'s roots only when there is a path between them. Unconnected
roots are not in `sfBA`. Doing a `PetscSFBcastBegin()`/`PetscSFBcastEnd()` on the new `PetscSF` is equivalent to doing a `PetscSFBcastBegin()`/`PetscSFBcastEnd()`
on `sfA`, then
a `PetscSFReduceBegin()`/`PetscSFReduceEnd()` on `sfB`, on connected roots.
