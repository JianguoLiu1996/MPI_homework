# TaoALMMSetMultipliers
Set user-defined Lagrange multipliers. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petsctao.h" 
PetscErrorCode TaoALMMSetMultipliers(Tao tao, Vec Y)
```

## Input Parameters

- ***tao -*** the `Tao` context for the `TAOALMM` solver
- ***Y -*** vector of Lagrange multipliers





## Notes
The vector type and parallel layout must match the equality and inequality constraints.

The vector must have a local size equal to the sum of the local sizes for the constraint vectors, and a
global size equal to the sum of the global sizes of the constraint vectors.

This routine is only useful if the user wants to change the
parallel distribution of the combined dual vector in problems that
feature both equality and inequality constraints. For other tasks,
it is strongly recommended that the user retrieve the dual vector
created by the solver using `TaoALMMGetMultipliers()`.
