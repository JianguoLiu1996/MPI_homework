# PetscSection
Mapping from integers in a designated range to contiguous sets of integers. 
## Synopsis
```
typedef struct _p_PetscSection *PetscSection;
```
The range of a `PetscSection` is in the space of
contiguous sets of integers. These ranges are frequently interpreted as domains of other array-like objects,
especially other `PetscSection`, `Vec`s, and `IS`s. The domain is set with `PetscSectionSetChart()` and does not need to
start at 0. For each point in the domain of a `PetscSection`, the output set is represented through an offset and a
count, which are set using `PetscSectionSetOffset()` and `PetscSectionSetDof()` respectively. Lookup is typically using
accessors or routines like `VecGetValuesSection()`.

The `PetscSection` object and methods are intended to be used in the PETSc `Vec` and `Mat` implementations. The indices returned by the `PetscSection`
are appropriate for the kind of `Vec` it is associated with. For example, if the vector being indexed is a local vector, we call the section a
local section. If the section indexes a global vector, we call it a global section. For parallel vectors, like global vectors, we use negative
indices to indicate dofs owned by other processes.
