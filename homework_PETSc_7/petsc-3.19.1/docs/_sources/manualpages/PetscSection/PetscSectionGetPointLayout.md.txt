# PetscSectionGetPointLayout
Get a `PetscLayout` for the points with nonzero dof counts of the unnamed default field within this `PetscSection`s local chart 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsection.h"   
PetscErrorCode PetscSectionGetPointLayout(MPI_Comm comm, PetscSection s, PetscLayout *layout)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***comm -*** The `MPI_Comm`
- ***s    -*** The `PetscSection`



## Output Parameter

- ***layout -*** The point layout for the data that defines the section





## Notes
`PetscSectionGetValueLayout()` provides similar information but counting the total number of degrees of freedom on the MPI process (excluding constrained
degrees of freedom).

This count includes constrained degrees of freedom

This is usually called on the default global section.


## Example
```none
     The chart is [2,5), point 2 has 2 dof, point 3 has 0 dof, point 4 has 1 dof
     The local size of the `PetscLayout` is 2 since 2 points have a non-zero number of dof
```



## Developer Note
I find the names of these two functions extremely non-informative
