# PetscSectionCreateGlobalSectionCensored
Create a `PetscSection` describing the globallayout using a local (sequential) `PetscSection` on each MPI process and an `PetscSF` describing the section point overlap. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsection.h"   
PetscErrorCode PetscSectionCreateGlobalSectionCensored(PetscSection s, PetscSF sf, PetscBool includeConstraints, PetscInt numExcludes, const PetscInt excludes[], PetscSection *gsection)
```

## Input Parameters

- ***s -*** The `PetscSection` for the local field layout
- ***sf -*** The `PetscSF` describing parallel layout of the section points
- ***includeConstraints -*** By default this is `PETSC_FALSE`, meaning that the global vector will not possess constrained dofs
- ***numExcludes -*** The number of exclusion ranges, this must have the same value on all MPI processes
- ***excludes -*** An array [start_0, end_0, start_1, end_1, ...] where there are `numExcludes` pairs and must have the same values on all MPI processes



## Output Parameter

- ***gsection -*** The `PetscSection` for the global field layout





## Notes
On each MPI process `gsection` inherits the chart of the `s` on that process.

This sets negative sizes and offsets to points not owned by this process as defined by `sf` but that are within the local value of the chart of `gsection`.
In those locations the value of size is -(size+1) and the value of the offset on the remote process is -(off+1).

This routine augments `PetscSectionCreateGlobalSection()` by allowing one to exclude certain ranges in the chart of the `PetscSection`


## Developer Note
This is a terrible function name
