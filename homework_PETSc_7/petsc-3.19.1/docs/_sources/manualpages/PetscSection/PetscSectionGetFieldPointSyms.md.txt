# PetscSectionGetFieldPointSyms
Get the symmetries for a set of points in a field of a `PetscSection` under specific orientations. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsection.h"   
PetscErrorCode PetscSectionGetFieldPointSyms(PetscSection section, PetscInt field, PetscInt numPoints, const PetscInt *points, const PetscInt ***perms, const PetscScalar ***rots)
```
Not Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***section -*** the section
- ***field -*** the field of the section
- ***numPoints -*** the number of points
- ***points -*** an array of size 2 * `numPoints`, containing a list of (point, orientation) pairs. (An orientation is an
arbitrary integer: its interpretation is up to sym.  Orientations are used by `DM`: for their interpretation in that
context, see `DMPlexGetConeOrientation()`).



## Output Parameters

- ***perms -*** The permutations for the given orientations (or `NULL` if there is no symmetry or the permutation is the identity).
- ***rots -*** The field rotations symmetries for the given orientations (or `NULL` if there is no symmetry or the rotations are all
identity).





## Notes
`PetscSectionSetFieldSym()` must have been previously called to provide the symmetries to the `PetscSection`

Use `PetscSectionRestoreFieldPointSyms()` when finished with the data
