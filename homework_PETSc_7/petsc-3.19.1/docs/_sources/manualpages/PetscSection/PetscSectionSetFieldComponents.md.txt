# PetscSectionSetFieldComponents
Sets the number of field components for the given field. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsection.h"   
PetscErrorCode PetscSectionSetFieldComponents(PetscSection s, PetscInt field, PetscInt numComp)
```
Not Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***s -*** the `PetscSection`
- ***field -*** the field number
- ***numComp -*** the number of field components





## Note
This number can be different than the values set with `PetscSectionSetFieldDof()`. It can be used to indicate the number of
components in the field of the underlying physical model which may be different than the number of degrees of freedom needed
at a point in a discretization. For example, if in three dimensions the field is velocity, it will have 3 components, u, v, and w but
an face based model for velocity (where the velocity normal to the face is stored) there is only 1 dof for each face point.

The value set with this function are not needed or used in `PetscSectionSetUp()`.


## Developer Note
This function is misnamed. There is a Num in `PetscSectionSetNumFields()` but not in this name
