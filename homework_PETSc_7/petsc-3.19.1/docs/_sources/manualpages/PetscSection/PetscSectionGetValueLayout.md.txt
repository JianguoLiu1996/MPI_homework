# PetscSectionGetValueLayout
Get the `PetscLayout` associated with the section dofs of a `PetscSection` 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsection.h"   
PetscErrorCode PetscSectionGetValueLayout(MPI_Comm comm, PetscSection s, PetscLayout *layout)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***comm -*** The `MPI_Comm`
- ***s    -*** The `PetscSection`



## Output Parameter

- ***layout -*** The dof layout for the section





## Notes
`PetscSectionGetPointLayout()` provides similar information but only counting the number of points with nonzero degrees of freedom and
including the constrained degrees of freedom

This is usually called for the default global section.


## Example
```none
     The chart is [2,5), point 2 has 4 dof (2 constrained), point 3 has 0 dof, point 4 has 1 dof (not constrained)
     The local size of the `PetscLayout` is 3 since there are 3 unconstrained degrees of freedom on this MPI process
```
