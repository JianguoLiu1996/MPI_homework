# PetscSectionSym
Symmetries of the data referenced by a `PetscSection`. 
## Synopsis
```
typedef struct _p_PetscSectionSym *PetscSectionSym;
```
Often the order of data index by a `PetscSection` is meaningful, and describes additional structure, such as points on a
line, grid, or lattice.  If the data is accessed from a different "orientation", then the image of the data under
access then undergoes a symmetry transformation.  A `PetscSectionSym` specifies these symmetries.  The types of
symmetries that can be specified are of the form R * P, where R is a diagonal matrix of scalars, and P is a permutation.
