# PetscSectionCreateSubdomainSection
Create a new, smaller section with support on a subdomain of the mesh 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsection.h"   
PetscErrorCode PetscSectionCreateSubdomainSection(PetscSection s, IS subpointMap, PetscSection *subs)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***s           -*** the `PetscSection`
- ***subpointMap -*** a sorted list of points in the original mesh which are in the subdomain



## Output Parameter

- ***subs -*** the subsection





## Notes
The point numbers remain the same as in the larger `PetscSection`, but the section offsets now refer to a new, smaller vector. The chart of `subs`
is `[min(subpointMap),max(subpointMap)+1)`

Compare this with `PetscSectionCreateSubmeshSection()` that maps the point numbers to start at zero


## Developer Notes
The use of the term Subdomain is unneeded and needs clarification, it is not specific to meshes. It appears to be just a subset of the chart of the original `PetscSection`
