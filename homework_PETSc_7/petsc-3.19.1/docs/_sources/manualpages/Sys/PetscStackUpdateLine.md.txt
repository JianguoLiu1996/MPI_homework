# PetscStackUpdateLine
in a function that has a `PetscFunctionBegin` or `PetscFunctionBeginUser` updates the stack line number to the current line number. Not Collective


## Synopsis
```
#include <petscsys.h>
void PetscStackUpdateLine
```



## Notes
Using `PetscCall()` and friends automatically handles this process

In debug mode PETSc maintains a stack of the current function calls that can be used to help to quickly see where a problem has
occurred, for example, when a signal is received. It is recommended to use the debugger if extensive information is needed to
help debug the problem.

The default stack is a global variable called petscstack.

This is used by `PetscCall()` and is otherwise not like to be needed
