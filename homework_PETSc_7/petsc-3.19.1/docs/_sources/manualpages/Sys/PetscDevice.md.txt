# PetscDevice
Object to manage an accelerator "device" (usually a GPU) 
## Synopsis
```
#include <petscdevicetypes.h> 
typedef struct _n_PetscDevice *PetscDevice;
```



## Notes
This object is used to house configuration and state of a device, but does not offer any
ability to interact with or drive device computation. This functionality is facilitated
instead by the `PetscDeviceContext` object.
