# PetscApproximateGTE
Performs a greater than or equal to on a given constant with a fudge for floating point numbers 
## Synopsis
```
#include <petscmath.h>
bool PetscApproximateGTE(PetscReal x,constant float)
```
Not Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***x -*** the variable
- ***b -*** the constant float it is checking if `x` is greater than or equal to





## Notes
The fudge factor is the value `PETSC_SMALL`

The constant numerical value is automatically set to the appropriate precision of PETSc so can just be provided as, for example, 3.2

This is used in several examples for setting initial conditions based on coordinate values that are computed with i*h that produces inexact
floating point results.
