# PetscLogGpuFlops
Log how many flops are performed in a calculation on the device 
## Synopsis
```
static inline PetscErrorCode PetscLogGpuFlops(PetscLogDouble n)
```

## Input Parameter

- ***flops -*** the number of flops





## Notes
To limit the chance of integer overflow when multiplying by a constant, represent the constant as a double,
not an integer. Use `PetscLogFlops`(4.0*n) not `PetscLogFlops`(4*n)

The values are also added to the total flop count for the MPI rank that is set with `PetscLogFlops()`; hence the number of flops
just on the CPU would be the value from set from `PetscLogFlops()` minus the value set from `PetscLogGpuFlops()`
