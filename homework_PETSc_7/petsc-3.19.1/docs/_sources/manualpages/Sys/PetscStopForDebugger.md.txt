# PetscStopForDebugger
Prints a message to the screen indicating how to attach to the process with the debugger and then waits for the debugger to attach. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsys.h"   
PetscErrorCode PetscStopForDebugger(void)
```
Not Collective


## Options Database Key

- ***-stop_for_debugger -*** will stop for you to attach the debugger when PetscInitialize() is called





## Note
This is likely never needed since `PetscAttachDebugger()` is easier to use and seems to always work.


## Developer Note
Since this can be called by the error handler, should it be calling `SETERRQ()` and `PetscCall()`?


## See Also
 `PetscSetDebugger()`, `PetscAttachDebugger()`
