# PetscSequentialPhaseBegin
Begins a sequential section of code. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsys.h"  
PetscErrorCode PetscSequentialPhaseBegin(MPI_Comm comm, int ng)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***comm -*** Communicator to sequentialize over
- ***ng   -*** Number in processor group.  This many processes are allowed to execute
at the same time (usually 1)





## Notes
`PetscSequentialPhaseBegin()` and `PetscSequentialPhaseEnd()` provide a
way to force a section of code to be executed by the processes in
rank order.  Typically, this is done with
```none
      PetscSequentialPhaseBegin(comm, 1);
      <code to be executed sequentially>
      PetscSequentialPhaseEnd(comm, 1);
```


You should use `PetscSynchronizedPrintf()` to ensure output between MPI ranks is properly order and not these routines.
