# PetscSSLInitializeContext
Set up an SSL context suitable for initiating HTTPS requests. 
## Synopsis
```
PetscErrorCode PetscSSLInitializeContext(SSL_CTX **octx)
```

## Output Parameter

- ***octx -*** the SSL_CTX to be passed to `PetscHTTPSConnect90`




If PETSc was ./configure -with-ssl-certificate requires the user have created a self-signed certificate with
```none
saws/CA.pl  -newcert  (using the passphrase of password)
```
```none
cat newkey.pem newcert.pem > sslclient.pem
```

and put the resulting file in either the current directory (with the application) or in the home directory. This seems kind of
silly but it was all I could figure out.
