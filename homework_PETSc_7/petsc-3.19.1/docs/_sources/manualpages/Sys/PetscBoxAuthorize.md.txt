# PetscBoxAuthorize
Get authorization and refresh token for accessing Box drive from PETSc 
## Synopsis
```
PetscErrorCode PetscBoxAuthorize(MPI_Comm comm, char access_token[], char refresh_token[], size_t tokensize)
```
Not Collective, only the first rank in `MPI_Comm` does anything


## Input Parameters

- ***comm -*** the MPI communicator
- ***tokensize -*** size of the token arrays



## Output Parameters

- ***access_token -*** can be used with `PetscBoxUpload()` for this one session
- ***refresh_token -*** can be used for ever to obtain new access_tokens with `PetscBoxRefresh()`, guard this like a password
it gives access to your Box Drive





## Notes
This call requires `stdout` and `stdin` access from process 0 on the MPI communicator

You can run src/sys/webclient/tutorials/boxobtainrefreshtoken to get a refresh token and then in the future pass it to
PETSc programs with `-box_refresh_token XXX`

This requires PETSc be installed using `--with-saws` or `--download-saws`

Requires the user have created a self-signed ssl certificate with
```none
    saws/CA.pl  -newcert  (using the passphrase of password)
    cat newkey.pem newcert.pem > sslclient.pem
```

and put the resulting file in either the current directory (with the application) or in the home directory. This seems kind of
silly but it was all I could figure out.
