# PetscFFlush
Flush a file stream 
## Synopsis
```
PetscErrorCode PetscFFlush(FILE *fd)
```

## Input Parameter

- ***fd -*** The file stream handle





## Notes
For output streams (and for update streams on which the last operation was output), writes
any unwritten data from the stream's buffer to the associated output device.

For input streams (and for update streams on which the last operation was input), the
behavior is undefined.

If `fd` is `NULL`, all open output streams are flushed, including ones not directly
accessible to the program.
