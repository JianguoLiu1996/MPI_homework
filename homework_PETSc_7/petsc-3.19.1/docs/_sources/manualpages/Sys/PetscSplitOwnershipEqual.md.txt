# PetscSplitOwnershipEqual
Given a global (or local) length determines a local (or global) length via a simple formula, trying to have all local lengths equal 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsys.h" 
PetscErrorCode PetscSplitOwnershipEqual(MPI_Comm comm, PetscInt *n, PetscInt *N)
```
Collective (if `n` or `N` is `PETSC_DECIDE`)


## Input Parameters

- ***comm -*** MPI communicator that shares the object being divided
- ***n -*** local length (or `PETSC_DECIDE` to have it set)
- ***N -*** global length (or `PETSC_DECIDE`)





## Notes
This is intended to be used with `MATSCALAPACK`, where the local size must
be equal in all processes (except possibly the last one). For instance,
the local sizes when splitting `N`=50 with 6 processes are 9,9,9,9,9,5

n and N cannot be both `PETSC_DECIDE`

If one processor calls this with `n` or `N` of `PETSC_DECIDE` then all processors
must. Otherwise, an error is thrown in debug mode while the program will hang
in optimized (i.e. configured --with-debugging=0) mode.
