# PetscDrawCollectiveBegin
Begins a set of draw operations Collective


## Synopsis
```
#include <petscdraw.h>
PetscErrorCode PetscDrawCollectiveBegin(PetscDraw draw)
```
Collective


## Input Parameter

- ***draw -*** the draw object





## Notes
This is a macro that handles its own error checking, it does not return an error code.

The set of operations needs to be ended by a call to `PetscDrawCollectiveEnd()`.

X windows draw operations that are enclosed by these routines handle correctly resizing or closing of
the window without crashing the program.


## Developer Note
This only applies to X windows and so should have a more specific name such as `PetscDrawXCollectiveBegin()`


## See Also
 `PetscDrawCollectiveEnd()`

## Level
advanced
