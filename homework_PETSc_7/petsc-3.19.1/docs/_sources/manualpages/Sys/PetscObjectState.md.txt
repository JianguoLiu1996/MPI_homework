# PetscObjectState
integer state for a `PetscObject` 


## Notes
Object state is always-increasing and (for objects that track state) can be used to determine if an object has
changed since the last time you interacted with it.  It is 64-bit so that it will not overflow for a very long time.


## See Also
 `PetscObjectId`, `PetscObjectStateGet()`, `PetscObjectStateIncrease()`, `PetscObjectStateSet()`
