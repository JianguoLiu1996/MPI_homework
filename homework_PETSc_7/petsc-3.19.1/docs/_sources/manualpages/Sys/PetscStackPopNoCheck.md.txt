# PetscStackPopNoCheck
Pops a function name from the PETSc default stack that tracks where the running program is currently in the source code. Not Collective


## Synopsis
```
#include <petscsys.h>
void PetscStackPopNoCheck(char *funct);
```

## Input Parameter

- ***funct -*** the function name





## Notes
Using `PetscCall()`, `PetscCallExternal()`, `PetscCallBack()` and friends negates the need to call this

In debug mode PETSc maintains a stack of the current function calls that can be used to help to quickly see where a problem has
occurred, for example, when a signal is received. It is recommended to use the debugger if extensive information is needed to
help debug the problem.

The default stack is a global variable called petscstack.


## Developer Note
`PetscStackPopNoCheck()` takes a function argument while  `PetscStackPop` does not, this difference is likely just historical.
