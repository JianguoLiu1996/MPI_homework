# PetscTimSortWithArray
Sorts an array in place in increasing order using Tim Peters adaptive sorting algorithm and reorders a second array to match the first. The arrays need not be the same type. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsys.h"  
PetscErrorCode PetscTimSortWithArray(PetscInt n, void *arr, size_t asize, void *barr, size_t bsize, int (*cmp)(const void *, const void *, void *), void *ctx)
```
Not Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***n     -*** number of values
- ***asize -*** size in bytes of the datatype held in arr
- ***bsize -*** size in bytes of the datatype held in barr
- ***cmp   -*** function pointer to comparison function
- ***ctx   -*** optional context to be passed to comparison function, NULL if not needed



## Input/Output Parameters

- ***arr  -*** array to be sorted, on output it is sorted
- ***barr -*** array to be reordered, on output it is reordered



## Notes
The arrays need not be of the same type, however barr MUST contain at least as many elements as arr and the two CANNOT
overlap.

Timsort makes the assumption that input data is already likely partially ordered, or that it contains contiguous
sections (termed 'runs') where the data is locally ordered (but not necessarily globally ordered). It therefore aims
to select slices of the array in such a way that resulting mergesorts operate on near perfectly length-balanced
arrays. To do so it repeatedly triggers attempts throughout to merge adjacent runs.

Should one run continuously "win" a comparison the algorithm begins the "gallop" phase. It will aggressively search
the "winner" for the location of the "losers" next entry (and vice versa) to copy all preceding elements into place in
bulk. However if the data is truly unordered (as is the case with random data) the immense gains possible from these
searches are expected __not__ to repay their costs. While adjacent arrays are almost all nearly the same size, they
likely all contain similar data.


## Sample usage
The comparison function must follow the `qsort()` comparison function paradigm, returning the sign of the difference
between its arguments. If left < right : return -1, if left == right : return 0, if left > right : return 1. The user
may also change or reverse the order of the sort by flipping the above. Note that stability of the sort is only
guaranteed if the comparison function forms a valid trigraph. For example when sorting an array of type "my_type" in
increasing order

```none
  int my_increasing_comparison_function(const void *left, const void *right, void *ctx) {
    my_type l = *(my_type *) left, r = *(my_type *) right;
    return (l < r) ? -1 : (l > r);
  }
```

Note the context is unused here but you may use it to pass and subsequently access whatever information required
inside the comparison function. The context pointer will unaltered except for any changes made inside the comparison function.
Then pass the function
```none
  PetscTimSortWithArray(n, arr, sizeof(arr[0]), barr, sizeof(barr[0]), my_increasing_comparison_function, ctx)
```



## Fortran Notes
To use this from fortran you must write a comparison subroutine with 4 arguments which accepts left, right, ctx and
returns result. For example
```none
 subroutine CompareIntegers(left,right,ctx,result)
   implicit none

   PetscInt,intent(in) :: left, right
   type(UserCtx)       :: ctx
   integer,intent(out) :: result

   if (left < right) then
     result = -1
   else if (left == right) then
     result = 0
   else
     result = 1
   end if
   return
 end subroutine CompareIntegers
```
