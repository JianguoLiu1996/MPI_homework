# PetscObjectInheritPrintedOptions
If the child object is not on the rank 0 process of the parent object and the child is sequential then the child gets it set. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscsys.h"    
PetscErrorCode PetscObjectInheritPrintedOptions(PetscObject pobj, PetscObject obj)
```

## Input Parameters

- ***pobj -*** the parent object
- ***obj  -*** the PetscObject





## Developer Notes
This is used, for example to prevent sequential objects that are created from a parallel object; such as the `KSP` created by
`PCBJACOBI` from all printing the same help messages to the screen

This will not handle more complicated situations like with `PCGASM` where children may live on any subset of the parent's processes and overlap
