# PetscTextBelt
Sends an SMS to an American/Canadian phone number 
## Synopsis
```
PetscErrorCode PetscTextBelt(MPI_Comm comm, const char number[], const char message[], PetscBool *flg)
```
Not Collective, only the first process in `MPI_Comm` does anything


## Input Parameters

- ***comm -*** the MPI communicator
- ***number -*** the 10 digit telephone number
- ***message -*** the message



## Output Parameter

- ***flg -*** `PETSC_TRUE` if the text was sent



## Options Database Key

- ***-textbelt <phonenumber[,message]> -*** sends a message to this number when the program ends





## Notes
TextBelt is run for testing purposes only, please do not use this feature often

As of November 2016 this service does not seem to be actually transmitting the SMS, which is unfortunate since it is such a great service. Consider
registering and using `PetscTellMyCell()` instead. Or email us with other alternatives we might add or make a pull request.


## Developer Note
I do not know how to make the buff[] long enough to receive the "success" string but short enough that the code does not hang
waiting for part of the message to arrive that does not exist, hence the success flg may be improperly set to false even
though the message was delivered.
