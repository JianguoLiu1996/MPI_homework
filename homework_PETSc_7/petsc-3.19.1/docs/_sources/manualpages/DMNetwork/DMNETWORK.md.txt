# DMNETWORK
"network" - A DM object that encapsulates an unstructured network. The implementation is based on the DM object DMPlex that manages unstructured grids. Distributed networks use a non-overlapping partitioning of the edges. In the local representation, Vecs contain all unknowns in the interior and shared boundary. This is specified by a PetscSection object. Ownership in the global representation is determined by ownership of the underlying DMPlex points. This is specified by another PetscSection object.
