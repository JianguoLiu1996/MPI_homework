# DMPlexDistributeOverlap
Add partition overlap to a distributed non-overlapping `DM`. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdmplex.h"   
#include "petscdmlabel.h"  
PetscErrorCode DMPlexDistributeOverlap(DM dm, PetscInt overlap, PetscSF *sf, DM *dmOverlap)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***dm  -*** The non-overlapping distributed `DMPLEX` object
- ***overlap -*** The overlap of partitions (the same on all ranks)



## Output Parameters

- ***sf -*** The `PetscSF` used for point distribution
- ***dmOverlap -*** The overlapping distributed `DMPLEX` object, or `NULL`



## Options Database Keys

- ***-dm_plex_overlap_labels <name1,name2,...> -*** List of overlap label names
- ***-dm_plex_overlap_values <int1,int2,...>   -*** List of overlap label values
- ***-dm_plex_overlap_exclude_label <name>     -*** Label used to exclude points from overlap
- ***-dm_plex_overlap_exclude_value <int>      -*** Label value used to exclude points from overlap





## Notes
If the mesh was not distributed, the return value is `NULL`.

The user can control the definition of adjacency for the mesh using `DMSetAdjacency()`. They should choose the combination appropriate for the function
representation on the mesh.
