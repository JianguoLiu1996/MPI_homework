# DMPlexFindVertices
Try to find DAG points based on their coordinates. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdmplex.h"   
#include "petscfe.h"       
PetscErrorCode DMPlexFindVertices(DM dm, Vec coordinates, PetscReal eps, IS *points)
```
Not Collective (provided `DMGetCoordinatesLocalSetUp()` has been already called)


## Input Parameters

- ***dm -*** The `DMPLEX` object
- ***coordinates -*** The `Vec` of coordinates of the sought points
- ***eps -*** The tolerance or `PETSC_DEFAULT`



## Output Parameter

- ***points -*** The `IS` of found DAG points or -1





## Notes
The length of `Vec` coordinates must be npoints * dim where dim is the spatial dimension returned by `DMGetCoordinateDim()` and npoints is the number of sought points.

The output `IS` is living on `PETSC_COMM_SELF` and its length is npoints.
Each rank does the search independently.
If this rank's local `DMPLEX` portion contains the DAG point corresponding to the i-th tuple of coordinates, the i-th entry of the output `IS` is set to that DAG point, otherwise to -1.

The output `IS` must be destroyed by user.

The tolerance is interpreted as the maximum Euclidean (L2) distance of the sought point from the specified coordinates.

Complexity of this function is currently O(mn) with m number of vertices to find and n number of vertices in the local mesh. This could probably be improved if needed.
