# DMPlexSetTree
set the tree that describes the hierarchy of non-conforming mesh points.  This routine also creates the point-to-point constraints determined by the tree: a point is constrained to the points in the closure of its tree root. 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdmplex.h"   
PetscErrorCode DMPlexSetTree(DM dm, PetscSection parentSection, PetscInt parents[], PetscInt childIDs[])
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***dm -*** the `DMPLEX` object
- ***parentSection -*** a section describing the tree: a point has a parent if it has 1 dof in the section; the section
offset indexes the parent and childID list; the reference count of parentSection is incremented
- ***parents -*** a list of the point parents; copied, can be destroyed
- ***childIDs -*** identifies the relationship of the child point to the parent point; if there is a reference tree, then
the child corresponds to the point in the reference tree with index childIDs; copied, can be destroyed
