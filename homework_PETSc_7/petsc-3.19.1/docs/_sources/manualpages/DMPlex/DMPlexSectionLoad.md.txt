# DMPlexSectionLoad
Loads section into a `DMPLEX` 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdmplex.h"   
PetscErrorCode DMPlexSectionLoad(DM dm, PetscViewer viewer, DM sectiondm, PetscSF globalToLocalPointSF, PetscSF *globalDofSF, PetscSF *localDofSF)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***dm          -*** The `DM` that represents the topology
- ***viewer      -*** The `PetscViewer` that represents the on-disk section (sectionA)
- ***sectiondm   -*** The `DM` into which the on-disk section (sectionA) is migrated
- ***globalToLocalPointSF -*** The `PetscSF` returned by `DMPlexTopologyLoad(`) when loading dm from viewer


Output Parameters

- ***globalDofSF -*** The `PetscSF` that migrates any on-disk `Vec` data associated with sectionA into a global `Vec` associated with the `sectiondm`'s global section (`NULL` if not needed)
- ***localDofSF  -*** The `PetscSF` that migrates any on-disk `Vec` data associated with sectionA into a local `Vec` associated with the `sectiondm`'s local section (`NULL` if not needed)





## Notes
This function is a wrapper around `PetscSectionLoad()`; it loads, in addition to the raw section, a list of global point numbers that associates each on-disk section point with a global point number in [0, NX), where NX is the number of topology points in `dm`. Noting that globalToLocalPointSF associates each topology point in dm with a global number in [0, NX), one can readily establish an association of the on-disk section points with the topology points.

In general `dm` and `sectiondm` are two different objects, the former carrying the topology and the latter carrying the section, and have been given a topology name and a section name, respectively, with `PetscObjectSetName()`. In practice, however, they can be the same object if it carries both topology and section; in that case the name of the object is used as both the topology name and the section name.

The output parameter, `globalDofSF` (`localDofSF`), can later be used with `DMPlexGlobalVectorLoad()` (`DMPlexLocalVectorLoad()`) to load on-disk vectors into global (local) vectors associated with sectiondm's global (local) section.


## Example using 2 processes
```none
  NX (number of points on dm): 4
  sectionA                   : the on-disk section
  vecA                       : a vector associated with sectionA
  sectionB                   : sectiondm's local section constructed in this function
  vecB (local)               : a vector associated with sectiondm's local section
  vecB (global)              : a vector associated with sectiondm's global section

                                     rank 0    rank 1
  vecA (global)                  : [.0 .4 .1 | .2 .3]        <- to be loaded in DMPlexGlobalVectorLoad() or DMPlexLocalVectorLoad()
  sectionA->atlasOff             :       0 2 | 1             <- loaded in PetscSectionLoad()
  sectionA->atlasDof             :       1 3 | 1             <- loaded in PetscSectionLoad()
  sectionA's global point numbers:       0 2 | 3             <- loaded in DMPlexSectionLoad()
  [0, NX)                        :       0 1 | 2 3           <- conceptual partition used in globalToLocalPointSF
  sectionB's global point numbers:     0 1 3 | 3 2           <- associated with [0, NX) by globalToLocalPointSF
  sectionB->atlasDof             :     1 0 1 | 1 3
  sectionB->atlasOff (no perm)   :     0 1 1 | 0 1
  vecB (local)                   :   [.0 .4] | [.4 .1 .2 .3] <- to be constructed by calling DMPlexLocalVectorLoad() with localDofSF
  vecB (global)                  :    [.0 .4 | .1 .2 .3]     <- to be constructed by calling DMPlexGlobalVectorLoad() with globalDofSF
```

where "|" represents a partition of loaded data, and global point 3 is assumed to be owned by rank 0.
