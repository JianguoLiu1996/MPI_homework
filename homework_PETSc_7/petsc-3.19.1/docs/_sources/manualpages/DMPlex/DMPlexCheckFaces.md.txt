# DMPlexCheckFaces
Check that the faces of each cell give a vertex order this is consistent with what we expect from the cell type 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdmplex.h"   
PetscErrorCode DMPlexCheckFaces(DM dm, PetscInt cellHeight)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***dm -*** The `DMPLEX` object
- ***cellHeight -*** Normally 0





## Notes
This is a useful diagnostic when creating meshes programmatically.
This routine is only relevant for meshes that are fully interpolated across all ranks.
It will error out if a partially interpolated mesh is given on some rank.
It will do nothing for locally uninterpolated mesh (as there is nothing to check).

For the complete list of DMPlexCheck* functions, see `DMSetFromOptions()`.
