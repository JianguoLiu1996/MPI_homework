# DMPlexCreateHybridMesh
Create a mesh with hybrid cells along an internal interface 
## Synopsis
```
#include "petscdmplex.h"    
#include "petscdmlabel.h"   
PetscErrorCode DMPlexCreateHybridMesh(DM dm, DMLabel label, DMLabel bdlabel, PetscInt bdvalue, DMLabel *hybridLabel, DMLabel *splitLabel, DM *dmInterface, DM *dmHybrid)
```
Collective


## Input Parameters

- ***dm -*** The original `DM`
- ***label -*** The label specifying the interface vertices
- ***bdlabel -*** The optional label specifying the interface boundary vertices
- ***bdvalue -*** Value of optional label specifying the interface boundary vertices



## Output Parameters

- ***hybridLabel -*** The label fully marking the interface, or `NULL` if no output is desired
- ***splitLabel -*** The label containing the split points, or `NULL` if no output is desired
- ***dmInterface -*** The new interface `DM`, or `NULL`
- ***dmHybrid -*** The new `DM` with cohesive cells





## Note
The hybridLabel indicates what parts of the original mesh impinged on the division surface. For points
directly on the division surface, they are labeled with their dimension, so an edge 7 on the division surface would be
7 (1) in hybridLabel. For points that impinge from the positive side, they are labeled with 100+dim, so an edge 6 with
one vertex 3 on the surface would be 6 (101) and 3 (0) in hybridLabel. If an edge 9 from the negative side of the
surface also hits vertex 3, it would be 9 (-101) in hybridLabel.

The splitLabel indicates what points in the new hybrid mesh were the result of splitting points in the original
mesh. The label value is $\pm 100+dim$ for each point. For example, if two edges 10 and 14 in the hybrid resulting from
splitting an edge in the original mesh, you would have 10 (101) and 14 (-101) in the splitLabel.

The dmInterface is a `DM` built from the original division surface. It has a label which can be retrieved using
`DMPlexGetSubpointMap()` which maps each point back to the point in the surface of the original mesh.
