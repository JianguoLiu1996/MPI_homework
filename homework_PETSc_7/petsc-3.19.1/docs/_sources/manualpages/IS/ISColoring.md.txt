# ISColoring
sets of IS's that define a coloring of something, such as a graph defined by a sparse matrix 
## Synopsis
```
typedef struct _n_ISColoring *ISColoring;
```



## Notes
One should not access the *is records below directly because they may not yet
have been created. One should use `ISColoringGetIS()` to make sure they are
created when needed.

When the coloring type is `IS_COLORING_LOCAL` the coloring is in the local ordering of the unknowns.
That is the matching the local (ghosted) vector; a local to global mapping must be applied to map
them to the global ordering.


## Developer Note
This is not a `PetscObject`
