.. important::

   petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov - a private maintenance e-mail without public archives - is
   also available. Send issues requiring large attachments here, in particular
   uncompressed ``configure.log`` and  ``make.log`` when encountering installation
   issues.


   Also see :ref:`doc_creepycrawly`.

.. note::

   - petsc-announce is an announcement-only list (users cannot post).
   - petsc-users and petsc-dev are open; we recommend subscribing and participating
     in the list discussions. However, it is possible to post to the lists without
     subscribing (the first post to the list will be held until list owner can
     enable access)
   - Avoid cross posting to multiple lists. You can reach PETSc developers equally
     on any suitable list.
