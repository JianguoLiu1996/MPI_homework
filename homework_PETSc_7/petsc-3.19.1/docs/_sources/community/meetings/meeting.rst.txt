Annual PETSc Meetings
*********************

The PETSc community hosts an annual PETSc-users conference in order to foster
continuous dialogue with our community. These yearly meetings allow us to (among other
things):

- Provide in-depth tutorials on how you can leverage the functionality in PETSc for your
  research.
- Highlight new functionality and progress made on long-term goals.
- Celebrate science achievements made possible by advances to PETSc's features and
  functionality.
- Describe advancements made not only by the PETSc team but also by applications
  developers and designers of simulation packages that use PETSc.
- Receive valuable feedback on current or requested features.

PETSc user meetings rely on two-way communication: PETSc developers provide insights into
the latest developments, whereas PETSc users provide input on both technical and
non-technical matters, hence aligning development with user needs. In particular, we
encourage you to present work illustrating your own use of PETSc. We also invite you to
contribute to the future of PETSc, helping identify strategies to encapsulate algorithmic
advances in state-of-the-art software, making possible more accurate, predictive
simulations by scientists and engineers.
