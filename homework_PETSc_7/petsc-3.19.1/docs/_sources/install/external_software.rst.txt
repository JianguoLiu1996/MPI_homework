Additional Software
===================

PETSc contains modifications of routines from:

- LINPACK (matrix factorization and solve; converted to C using f2c and then
  hand-optimized for small matrix sizes)
- MINPACK (sequential matrix coloring routines for finite difference Jacobian evaluations;
  converted to C using f2c)
- SPARSPAK (matrix reordering routines, converted to C using f2c, this is the PUBLIC
  DOMAIN version of SPARSPAK)
- libtfs (the scalable parallel direct solver created and written by Henry Tufo and Paul
  Fischer).

Instrumentation of PETSc:

- PETSc can be instrumented using the `TAU
  <http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/paracomp/tau/tautools/>`__ package (check
  :ref:`installation <doc_config_tau>` instructions).

PETSc documentation has been generated using:

- `Sowing <http://wgropp.cs.illinois.edu/projects/software/sowing/index.html>`__
- `c2html <https://sources.debian.org/copyright/license/c2html/>`__
- `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__
