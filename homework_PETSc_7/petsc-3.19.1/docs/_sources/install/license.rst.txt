Contributing License Agreement
==============================

Contributions are accepted via `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc>`__ merge requests.
If you are planning a large contribution, we encourage you to discuss the concept on the
petsc-dev@mcs.anl.gov :ref:`mailing list <doc_mail>` and interact with us frequently to
ensure that your effort is well-directed. See the developers :ref:`documentation
<ind_developers>` for further details.

PETSc is distributed under a 2-clause :ref:`BSD license <doc_license>` (see above). The
act of submitting a merge request (with or without an explicit Signed-off-by tag) will be
understood as an affirmation of the following:

  (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
      of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
      license and I have the right under that license to submit that
      work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
      by me, under the same open source license (unless I am

      in the file; or

Legacy License

   PETSc is now distributed under a 2-clause :ref:`BSD license <doc_license>`. This
   section containing the (roughly compatible) legacy PETSc license exists for
   **historical purposes only**.
