   download versions. Complex version of these packages are now
   supported.
-  Added Support for QR factorization into PETSc/SPOOLES interface
   (Seq)
-  Added Support for installing PETSc with TAU instrumentation
   package. Please check config files in bmake/linux_tau.
-  Added support for Cray SX-6 vector machine

.. rubric:: Vec:
