========================
Changes for each release
========================

We will continually add new features and enhanced functionality in
upcoming releases; **small changes in usage and calling sequences of
PETSc routines will continue to occur**. We use the C/C++ deprecation
feature (which prints deprecation warnings) to allow users to continue
to use older interfaces until they update their codes. Although keeping one's code
accordingly up-to-date can be annoying, all PETSc users will be
rewarded in the long run with a cleaner, better designed, and
easier-to-use interface.

We suggest that users who want to upgrade their current PETSc
application codes from a particular version to the most recent
release proceed through the changes listed in this file in increasing
order of version numbers. (Note: One can determine the release number
of any current PETSc installation by looking in the file
include/petscversion.h) Many of the interface changes can be handled
quickly and easily by using global replacement via your favorite text
editor.
