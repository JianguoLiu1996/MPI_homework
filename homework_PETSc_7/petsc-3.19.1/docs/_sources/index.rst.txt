PETSc |version|
===============
PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation,
pronounced PET-see (`/ˈpɛt-siː/ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English#Key>`__), is
for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific
applications modeled by partial differential equations. It has bindings for C, Fortran, and Python (via :any:`petsc4py<petsc4py_api>`).
PETSc also contains TAO, the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization, software library.
It supports MPI, and GPUs through
CUDA, HIP or OpenCL, as well as hybrid MPI-GPU parallelism; it also supports the NEC-SX Tsubasa Vector Engine.
Immediately jump in and run PETSc code :any:`handson`.

PETSc is developed as :ref:`open-source <doc_license>`, requests and contributions are welcome.
