PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation,
includes a large suite of scalable parallel **linear and nonlinear
equation solvers, ODE integrators, and optimization algorithms** for application codes written in
C, C++, Fortran, and Python. In addition, PETSc includes support for
managing parallel PDE discretizations including parallel matrix and vector assembly routines. :any:`doc_toolkits_use_petsc`.
