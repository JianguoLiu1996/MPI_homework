===================
GitLab CI Pipelines
===================

PETSc uses `GitLab Pipelines <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/>`__ for testing during continuous integration.

Do not overdo requesting testing; it is a limited resource, so if you
realize a currently running pipeline is no longer needed, cancel it.

The pipeline status for a merge request (MR) is displayed near the top of the MR page, and in the pipelines tab.

(The figures below are high resolution, so zoom in if needbe)

   Pipeline status for a merge request (MR)

To un-pause the pipeline, click the "play" button (or start a new one with "Run Pipeline" if necessary).

   Un-pausing a pipeline.

A pipeline consists of ``Stages`` each with multiple ``Jobs``: each of these is one configuration on one machine.

   Examining a failed pipeline stage.

You can see the failed jobs by clicking on the  X.

.. figure:: /images/developers/find-exact-bad-job.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

   Locating the exact failed job in a pipeline stage.

A job is a run of the :any:`PETSc test harness<test_harness>` and consists of many "examples".
Each test is a run of an example with a particular set of command line options

A failure in running the job's tests will have ``FAILED`` and a list of the failed tests

.. figure:: /images/developers/failed-examples.png
   :align: center

   Failed examples in a pipeline job.

Search for ``not ok`` in the jobs output to find the exact failure

.. figure:: /images/developers/unfreed-memory.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

   A test which failed because of unfreed memory.

Examples of pipeline failures
=============================


If your source code is not properly formatted you will see an error from ``make checkbadSource``. You should always run ``make checkbadSource`` on your machine
before submitting a pipeline.

.. figure:: /images/developers/badsource.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

   ``checkbadSource`` failure.

.. figure:: /images/developers/another-failure.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

   A test failing with a PETSc error.

.. figure:: /images/developers/error-compiling-source.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

   Error in compiling the source code.

You can download the ``configure.log`` file to find the problem by using the "Browse" button and following the paths to the configure file.

.. figure:: /images/developers/pipeline-configure.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

   Error in running configure.

.. figure:: /images/developers/pipeline-configure-browse.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

   Downloading ``configure.log`` from a failed pipeline job.

When there are failures in some jobs and a fix has been pushed, one can save time by testing only the previously
failed jobs, before running the full pipeline. To do this, un-pause a
new pipeline (do **not** retry the previous pipeline from before your most recent push), cancel
the pipeline on the pipeline page,

.. figure:: /images/developers/cancel-pipeline.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

   Canceling a pipeline.

then retry the failed jobs by using the  "Retry"
circular button to the right of job name.

.. figure:: /images/developers/retry-job.png

   :width: 90%

   Retrying a job.

.. figure:: /images/developers/started-retry-job.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

   A job after retrying.

If the selected jobs are
successful, run the rest of the pipeline by using the "Retry"
button at the top of the pipeline

.. figure:: /images/developers/retry-pipeline.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

   Retrying a pipeline.

The "Retry" button at the top of of a previous pipeline or job does **not** use any
new changes to the branch you have pushed since that pipeline was started - it retries exactly the
same git commit that was previously tried. The job "Retry" should only be used in this way
when you suspect the testing system has some intermittent error that is unrelated to your branch.

Please report all "odd" errors in the testing that donâ€™t seem related
to your branch in `this tracking issue <https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/issues/951>`__.

1. Check the issue's threads to see if the error is listed and add it there, with a link to your MR (e.g. ``!1234``). Otherwise, create a new thread.
2. Click the three dots in the top right of the thread and select "Copy link".
3. Add this link in your MR description.
