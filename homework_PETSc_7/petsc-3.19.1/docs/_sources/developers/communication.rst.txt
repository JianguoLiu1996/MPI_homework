===========================================
Communication Channels for PETSc Developers
===========================================

GitLab
======

Day-to-day development happens at the `PETSc GitLab repository <https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc>`__.
There, you can find the history and development version of the source code,
`see or create issues <https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/issues>`__,
`see or create merge requests <https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/merge_requests>`__,
and more. Also see :doc:`integration`.

Mailing Lists
=============

Please consider joining the :ref:`mailing lists <doc_mail>`.

Comments and questions regarding PETSc design and development should go to petsc-dev@mcs.anl.gov.

Configuration issues (with ``make.log`` and ``configure.log`` attached) should be reported to petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov.

For bugs and other issues, we encourage developers to create a `GitLab <https://gitlab.com>`__ account and
`file issues directly <https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/issues>`__;
this allows better tracking of long-term bug reports and feature requests.

General questions regarding the use of PETSc can, as usual, go to petsc-users@mcs.anl.gov (public)
or petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov (private, can handle large attachments).

Responding to User Requests and Questions
-----------------------------------------

PETSc users communicate to the PETSc team via the mailing lists
petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov and petsc-users@mcs.anl.gov. When responding there,
please follow these guidelines:

* Be polite and behave according to the `Code of Conduct <https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_.
* Address the person by name (when you can determine a name).
* Apologize for the problem when it is appropriate.
* Thank the person for their patience if it is more than six hours since the report came in.
* If the person drops "petsc-maint" or "petsc-users" from the reply list, add it back.
* Donâ€™t ask too many questions or give too many suggestions in the same email. The user often responds only to the first of them or becomes confused.
